      <td>The impact of chronotype on circadian rest-activity rhythm and sleep characteristics across the week</td>
      <td>Circadian rhythms are maintained by a complex system of systems that continuously coordinates biological processes with each other and the environment. Although humans predominantly entrain to solar time, individual persons vary in their precise behavioral timing due to endogenous and exogenous factors. Endogenous differences in the timing of individual circadian rhythms relative to a common environmental cue are known as chronotypes, ranging from earlier than average (Morningness) to later than average (Eveningness). Furthermore, individual behavior is often constrained by social constructs such as the 7-day week, and the sociogenic impact our social calendar has on our behavioral rhythms is likely modified by chronotype. Our aim in this study was to identify and characterize differences in sleep and rest-activity rhythms (RAR) between weekends and weekdays and between-chronotypes. Male volunteers (n = 24, mean age = 23.46 y) were actigraphically monitored for 4 weeks to derive objective behavioral measures of sleep and RARs. Chronotype was assessed through self-report on the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire. Sleep characteristics were derived using Actiware; daily rest-activity rhythms were modeled using a basic 3-parameter cosinor function. We observed that both Eveningness and Morningness Chronotypes were more active and slept later on the weekends than on weekdays. Significant between-chronotype differences in sleep timing and duration were observed within individual days of the week, especially during transitions between weekends and the workweek. Moreover, chronotypes significantly varied in their weekly rhythms: e.g. Morningness Chronotypes generally shifted their sleep duration, timing and quality across work/rest transitions quicker than Eveningness Chronotypes. Although our results should be interpreted with caution due to the limitations of our cosinor model and a homogenous cohort, they reinforce a growing body of evidence that day of the week, chronotype and their interactions must be accounted for in observational studies of human behavior, especially when circadian rhythms are of interest.</td>

      <td>Meteorological rhythms of respiratory and circulatory diseases revealed by Harmonic Analysis</td>
      <td>The intricately fluctuating onset of respiratory and circulatory diseases displays rhythms of multi-scaled meteorological conditions due to their sensitivity to weather changes. The intrinsic meteorological rhythms of these diseases are revealed in this bio-meteorological study via Fourier decomposition and harmonic analysis. Daily emergency room (ER) visit data for respiratory and circulatory diseases from three comprehensive hospitals in Haidian district of Beijing, China were used in the analysis. Meteorological data included three temperature metrics, relative humidity, sunshine duration, daily mean air pressure, and wind speed. The Fourier decomposition and harmonic analysis on ER visits and meteorological variables involve frequency, period, and power of all harmonics. The results indicated that: i) for respiratory morbidity, a strong climatic annual rhythm responding to annual temperature change was firstly revealed; its ratio of spectral density was 16-33%. Moreover, significant correlations existed between the high-frequency fluctuations (&lt;30 d) of morbidity and short-term harmonics of humidity and solar duration. High-frequency harmonics of temperature and pressure showed no statistically significant effect. ii) With regard to all types of circulatory morbidity, their annual periodicity was weaker than that of respiratory diseases, whose harmonic energy took a ratio less than 8%. Besides, the power of all high-frequency harmonics of circulatory morbidity accounted for up to 70-90% in the original sequences, and their relationship to many short-term meteorological factors were significant, including the mean and maximum temperatures, wind speed, and solar duration. iii) The weekly rhythm appeared in respiratory ER visits with 15% of harmonic variance but not prominent in circulatory morbidity. In summary, by decomposing the sequence of respiratory and circulatory diseases as well as recognizing their meteorological rhythms, different responses to meteorological conditions on various time scales were identified.</td>

      <td>Increased salt consumption induces body water conservation and decreases fluid intake</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND. The idea that increasing salt intake increases drinking and urine volume is widely accepted. We tested the hypothesis that an increase in salt intake of 6 g/d would change fluid balance in men living under ultra-long-term controlled conditions.METHODS. Over the course of 2 separate space flight simulation studies of 105 and 205 days' duration, we exposed 10 healthy men to 3 salt intake levels (12, 9, or 6 g/d). All other nutrients were maintained constant. We studied the effect of salt-driven changes in mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid urinary excretion on day-to-day osmolyte and water balance.RESULTS. A 6-g/d increase in salt intake increased urine osmolyte excretion, but reduced free-water clearance, indicating endogenous free water accrual by urine concentration. The resulting endogenous water surplus reduced fluid intake at the 12-g/d salt intake level. Across all 3 levels of salt intake, half-weekly and weekly rhythmical mineralocorticoid release promoted free water reabsorption via the renal concentration mechanism. Mineralocorticoid-coupled increases in free water reabsorption were counterbalanced by rhythmical glucocorticoid release, with excretion of endogenous osmolyte and water surplus by relative urine dilution. A 6-g/d increase in salt intake decreased the level of rhythmical mineralocorticoid release and elevated rhythmical glucocorticoid release. The projected effect of salt-driven hormone rhythm modulation corresponded well with the measured decrease in water intake and an increase in urine volume with surplus osmolyte excretion.CONCLUSION. Humans regulate osmolyte and water balance by rhythmical mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid release, endogenous accrual of surplus body water, and precise surplus excretion.</td>

      <td>Circaseptan (about 7-day) modulation of circadian rhythm in corneal mitoses of Holtzman rats.</td>
      <td>An infradian modulation with a 168 h or circaseptan period characterizes epithelial corneal mitoses in adult female and male Holtzman rats, standardized at 24 +/- 1 degree C and approximately 50% relative humidity on six different sequences of light (L) alternating every 12 h with darkness (D). To approximate sampling over a 24 h LD span by convenient sampling within a single hour, the LD 12:12 regimen was staggered by 4 h in the six environments. Bedding was changed 3 days before each day of killing. During each of eight or 12 consecutive days, male and female rats, respectively, were killed and the eyeballs were removed. Mitotic indices in the cornea were determined separately for each eye and the data were analyzed by linear and nonlinear least-squares rhythmometry. For a prominent circadian component of mitotic activity, the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the period extends from 23.6 to 24.3 h for the data from males and from 23.7 to 24.2 h for those from female rats. The circadian amplitude is larger in males as compared to females. The peaks in the 24 h cosine functions best approximating the data, the circadian acrophases, are at -64 degrees or -48 degrees, i.e., 4 h 16 min or 3 h 12 min from lights-on in male and female rats, respectively. In the data from the two genders, the 24 h synchronized circadian acrophases are thus only 16 degrees, i.e., 1 h and 4 min apart. A test for an anticipated circaseptan (7-day) period shows that this particular infradian periodicity is superimposed upon the circadian one in data from both genders.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</td>

      <td>Immediate and delayed incorporations of events into dreams: further replication and implications for dream function.</td>
      <td>The incorporation of memories into dreams is characterized by two types of temporal effects: the day-residue effect, involving immediate incorporations of events from the preceding day, and the dream-lag effect, involving incorporations delayed by about a week. This study was designed to replicate these two effects while controlling several prior methodological problems and to provide preliminary information about potential functions of delayed event incorporations. Introductory Psychology students were asked to recall dreams at home for 1 week. Subsequently, they were instructed to select a single dream and to retrieve past events related to it that arose from one of seven randomly determined days prior to the dream (days 1-7). They then rated both their confidence in recall of events and the extent of correspondence between events and dreams. Judges evaluated qualities of the reported events using scales derived from theories about the function of delayed incorporations. Average ratings of correspondences between dreams and events were high for predream days 1 and 2, low for days 3 and 4 and high again for days 5-7, but only for participants who rated their confidence in recall of events as high and only for females. Delayed incorporations were more likely than immediate incorporations to refer to events characterized by interpersonal interactions, spatial locations, resolved problems and positive emotions. The findings are consistent with the possibility that processes with circaseptan (about 7 days) morphology underlie dream incorporation and that these processes subserve the functions of socio-emotional adaptation and memory consolidation.</td>

      <td>What's the Healthiest Day? Circaseptan (Weekly) Rhythms in Healthy Considerations</td>
      <td>Background: Biological clocks govern numerous aspects of human health, including weekly clocks-called circaseptan rhythms-that typically include early-week spikes for many illnesses.Purpose: To determine whether contemplations for healthy behaviors also follow circaseptan rhythms.Methods: We assessed healthy contemplations by monitoring Google search queries (2005-2012) in the U.S. that included the word healthy and were Google classified as health-related (e.g., healthy diet). A wavelet analysis was used in 2013 to isolate the circaseptan rhythm, with the resulting series compared by estimating ratios of relative query volume (healthy versus all queries) each day (e.g., (Monday-Wednesday)/Wednesday).Results: Healthy searches peaked on Monday and Tuesday, thereafter declining until rebounding modestly on Sunday. Monday and Tuesday were statistically indistinguishable (t=1.22, p=0.22), but their combined mean had 30% (99% CI=29, 32) more healthy queries than the combined mean for Wednesday Sunday. Monday and Tuesday query volume was 3% (99% CI=2, 5) greater than Wednesday, 15% (99% CI=13, 17) greater than Thursday, 49% (99% CI=46, 52) greater than Friday, 80% (99% CI=76, 84) greater than Saturday, and 29% (99% CI=27, 31) greater than Sunday. We explored media-based (priming) motivations for these patterns and they were consistently rejected.Conclusions: Just as many illnesses have a weekly clock, so do healthy considerations. Discovery of these rhythms opens the door for a new agenda in preventive medicine, including implications for hypothesis development, research strategies to further explore these rhythms, and interventions to exploit daily cycles in healthy considerations.

      <td>Circadian and circaseptan rhythmicities in corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) binding activity of human milk.</td>
      <td>It has been demonstrated that human milk contains a corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG, transcortin) which is very similar to that isolated from plasma. It is agreed, moreover, that the cortisol environment of the breast is important for the synthesis of major milk proteins. It was of interest, therefore, to investigate whether milk transcortin exhibits circadian variations in the binding activity as does the plasma counterpart. Twelve lactating women, aged 23-35 years, collected specimens of milk just before feeding at different times of the 24-h cycle for 3 consecutive days in the first week of lactation. Six women extended milk collection for at least a 28-days span in the first 2 months of lactation. To obtain whey, milk was centrifuged in cellulose nitrate tubes at 105,000 g for 30 min at 4 degrees C. Specific cortisol binding activity of CBG was measured by an adsorption technique and data were expressed as a function of protein content. Cortisol levels in milk were measured by radioimmunoassay. Rhythmometric analyses (single- and mean-cosinor procedures) yielded detection of a significant circadian rhythm in 'apparent specific binding activity' for cortisol (ASBA-F) whereas no significant oscillation was found as far as milk cortisol concentrations were concerned. Mean acrophase of the CBG-binding activity in milk was located in the evening, lagging behind the corresponding activity in serum by approximately 8 h. A circaseptan rhythmicity in milk binding activity was also present in our longitudinal series at a high level of significance. These results provide evidence that CBG binding activity in human milk has a clear circadian rhythm in the face of ecchronic milk cortisol concentrations. Phase-shift with regard to the rhythm of the plasma counterpart may be accounted for by processes of milk accumulation before nursing The significance of circadian and circaseptan variations in specific cortisol (and other steroids) binding in milk awaits further investigation.</td>

      <td>Circadian and circaseptan rhythms in human epilepsy: a retrospective cohort study</td>
      <td>Background Epilepsy has long been suspected to be governed by cyclic rhythms, with seizure rates rising and falling periodically over weeks, months, or even years. The very long scales of seizure patterns seem to defy natural explanation and have sometimes been attributed to hormonal cycles or environmental factors. This study aimed to quantify the strength and prevalence of seizure cycles at multiple temporal scales across a large cohort of people with epilepsy.Methods This retrospective cohort study used the two most comprehensive databases of human seizures (SeizureTracker [USA] and NeuroVista [Melbourne, VIC, Australia]) and analytic techniques from circular statistics to analyse patients with epilepsy for the presence and frequency of multitemporal cycles of seizure activity. NeuroVista patients were selected on the basis of having intractable focal epilepsy; data from patients with at least 30 clinical seizures were used. SeizureTracker participants are self selected and data do not adhere to any specific criteria; we used patients with a minimum of 100 seizures. The presence of seizure cycles over multiple time scales was measured using the mean resultant length (R value). The Rayleigh test and Hodges-Ajne test were used to test for circular uniformity. Monte-Carlo simulations were used to confirm the results of the Rayleigh test for seizure phase.Findings We used data from 12 people from the NeuroVista study (data recorded from June 10, 2010, to Aug 22, 2012) and 1118 patients from the SeizureTracker database (data recorded from Jan 1, 2007, to Oct 19, 2015). At least 891 (80%) of 1118 patients in the SeizureTracker cohort and 11 (92%) of 12 patients in the NeuroVista cohort showed circadian (24 h) modulation of their seizure rates. In the NeuroVista cohort, patient 8 had a significant cycle at precisely 1 week. Two others (patients 1 and 7) also had approximately 1-week cycles. Patients 1 and 4 had 2-week cycles. In the SeizureTracker cohort, between 77 (7%) and 233 (21%) of the 1118 patients showed strong circaseptan (weekly) rhythms, with a clear 7-day period. Between 151 (14%) and 247 (22%) patients had significant seizure cycles that were longer than 3 weeks. Seizure cycles were equally prevalent in men and women, and peak seizure rates were evenly distributed across all days of the week.Interpretation Our results suggest that seizure cycles are robust, patient specific, and more widespread than previously understood. They align with the accepted consensus that most epilepsies have some diurnal influence. Variations in seizure rate have important clinical implications. Detection and tracking of seizure cycles on a patient-specific basis should be standard in epilepsy management practices. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

      <td>Chronomics and Glocal (combined global and local) assessment of human life</td>
      <td>Most organisms, from cyanobacteria to mammals, are known to use circadian mechanism to coordinate their activities with the natural 24-hour light/dark cycle and/or interacting socio-ecologic schedules. When the human clock gene was discovered in 1997, it was surprising, to see that it was very similar in all earthly life. Recent findings suggest that organisms which evolved on Earth acquired many of the visible and invisible cycles of their habitat and/or of their cosmos.While circadian systems are well documented both time-macroscopically and time-microscopically, the temporal organization of physiological function is much more extensive. Long-term physiological quasi-ambulatory monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate, among other variables, Such as diose of the ECG and other tools of the neuroendocrinologic armamentarium, have already yielded information, among, others, oil circaseptan (about 7-day), transyears and cisyears (with periods slightly longer or shorter than one year, respectively), and circadecennian (about 10-year) cycles: the nervous system displays rhythms, chaos and trends, mapped as chronomes.Chronomes are time structures consisting of multifrequency rhythms covering frequencies over IS orders of magnitude, elements of chaos, trends in chaotic and rhythmic end points, and other, as-yet unresolved variability. These resolvable time structures, chronomes, in Lis have counterparts around us, also consisting of rhythms, trends and chaos, as is increasingly being recognized. In 2000, we began a community-based study, relying on 7-day/24-hour monitoring of blood pressure as a public service. Our goal was the prevention of stroke and myocardial infarction and of the decline in cognitive function of the elderly in a community. Chronomic detection of elevated illness-risks aim at; the prevention of diseases of individuals, such as myocardial infarctions and strokes, and, equally important, chronomics resolves illness of societies, such as crime and war. all exhibiting some already mapped cycles, that are indispensable for the study of underlying mechanisms.A variety of cognitive, neurobehavioral and neuropsychological as well as cardiovascular functions will need to be investigated to more precisely map their chronomes in space and time, in order to understand chronoastrobiology, based on both the system times and time horizons yielded by chronomes assessed in communities worldwide. Thus, we critically introduce a preventive health care, while keeping the flow of data, for the assessment of space weather and its consequences in the evolution thus far of terrestrial life.</td>

      <td>Intake of total calories, proteins, lipids and carbohydrates was measured individually in four separate groups each of 26 to 29 children studied during different seasons of the year and an additional group of eight children investigated during all seasons. The subjects came from broken homes, had been abandoned or were orphans; 60% were males, 4 +/- 1.5 years of age (mean and standard error) and were of similar body weight and height. They were residents in one of two separate institutions in Nancy, France, living on similar, rigorously enforced schedules unchanged throughout the year. Socio-ecologic synchronization involved lights-on at 0700 lights-out at 1830, meals at 0800, 100, 1400 and 1800 with food of similar origin and kind, and similar timing of mental and physical activities. Each child was asked at fixed meal times to select spontaneously the kind and amount of food desired, uninfluenced as far as possible by choices of others, and to consume the food in any order. During seven days of adherence to this request, the amounts of protein, lipid, carbohydrate and total calories consumed at each meal were carefully determined for each individual. Time series thus obtained were analyzed according to the mean cosinor method for detecting and characterizing bioperiodic phenomena. A statistically significant circadian rhythm was detected in each of the 4 variables for each day of the best fitting sine function used to approximate the rhythm occurred around noon in almost all the studied circumstances. In other words the spontaneously larger meals were usually taken at 0800 (breakfast) and 1800 (supper). The trough of both lipid and protein spontaneous intake was clustered around 1800 only on Sunday. Cosinor analysis of individual seven-day time series (of each variable of each season) indicated a statistically significant circaseptan (approximately equal to 7-days) rhythm, with a peak occuring on Saturday, Sunday or Monday, but never on Wednesday. Changes in the weekly mean adjusted levels obtained by this method (as well as changes in mean values resulting from other statistical methods) demonstrate: 1) a circannual variation in spontaneous intake of lipids, carbohydrates and calories (protein changes are not statistically significant): 2) a peak of lipid intake, occuring in spring time, and a peak of carbohydrate and calorie intake, occuring in summer time. The probability of both exogenous and endogenous components of these rhythms is suggested.</td>

      <td>Background: Previous in-hospital studies suggest that there are significant circadian rhythms associated with the incidence of acute coronary syndromes (ACSs). No study to date has examined the presentation of ACS in the prehospital setting. Our goal was to examine circadian, day-of-week, and age patterns of occurrence in ACS in a large, urban emergency medical services (EMS) system.Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic prehospital medical records from the Beijing's EMS system spanning August 1, 2005, to July 31, 2007. Data were analyzed by hour of the day and day of the week. chi(2) tests were performed to compare the difference.Results: Seven thousand thirty-two cases of ACS were identified by the EMS system physicians during the 2-year study period, including 536 cases of acute myocardial infarction. A significant variation of circadian distribution of ACS was observed in both 24-hour (P &lt; .001) and 2-hour (P &lt; .001) interval time course. Two peaks were observed in the morning from 0800 to 1000 and approaching midnight from 2200 to 2400. Increases of 50% and 60.8% in the morning and evening peaks were found, respectively, when compared with the early morning baseline (nadir). No significant difference was found among the accumulated cases in 2 years on each day in a week (P = .203).Conclusions: Our study shows that, in the Beijing metropolitan area, the presentation of ACS has significant circadian rhythm characterized by 2 peaks within 24 hours, the morning peak is 0800 to 1000, and the late evening peak is 2200 to 2400.

      <td>Depending on their degree of maturation, costimulatory molecule expression, and cytokine secretion, dendritic cells (DC) can induce immunity or tolerance. DC treated with mycophenolic acid during their maturation (MPA-DC) have a regulatory phenotype and may therefore provide a new approach to induce allograft tolerance. Purified CD4(+) T cells stimulated in a human in vitro model of mixed culture by allogeneic MPA-DC displayed much weaker proliferation than T cells activated by mature DC and were anergic. This hyporesponsiveness was alloantigen-specific. Interestingly, T cells stimulated by MPA-DC during long-term coculture in four 7-day cycles displayed potent, suppressive activity, as revealed by marked inhibition of the proliferation of naive and preactivated control T cells. These regulatory T cells (Tregs) appeared to have antigen specificity and were contact-dependent. Tregs induced by MPA-DC were CD25(+) glucocorticoid-induced TNFR(+)CTLA-4(+)CD95(+), secreted IL-5 and large amounts of IL-10 and TGF-beta, and displayed enhanced forkhead box p3 expression. These results obtained in vitro demonstrate that human MPA-DC can induce allospecific Tregs that may be exploited in cell therapy to induce allograft tolerance.</td>

We compared the effects of an experimental dynamic lighting schedule (DLS) with a standard static lighting schedule (SLS) on circadian phase, self-reported sleep and cognition during a 45-day simulated space mission. Sixteen participants (mean age [+/- SD] 37.4 +/- 6.7 years; 5 F; n = 8/lighting condition) were studied in four-person teams at the NASA Human Exploration Research Analog. Participants were scheduled to sleep 8 h/night on two weekend nights, 5 h/night on five weekday nights, repeated for six 7-day cycles, with scheduled waketime fixed at 7:00 a.m. Compared to the SLS where illuminance and spectrum remained constant during wake (similar to 4000K), DLS increased the illuminance and short-wavelength (blue) content of white light (similar to 6000K) approximately threefold in the main workspace (Level 1), until 3 h before bedtime when illuminance was reduced by -96% and the blue content also reduced throughout (similar to 4000K x 2 h, similar to 3000K x 1 h) until bedtime. The average (+/- SE) urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) acrophase time was significantly later in the SLS (6.22 +/- 0.34 h) compared to the DLS (4.76 +/- 0.53 h) and more variable in SLS compared to DLS (37.2 +/- 3.6 min vs. 28.2 +/- 2.4 min, respectively, p = .04). Compared to DLS, self-reported sleep was more frequently misaligned relative to circadian phase in SLS RR: 6.75, 95% CI 1.55-29.36, p = .01), but neither self-reported sleep duration nor latency to sleep was different between lighting conditions. Accuracy in the abstract matching and matrix reasoning tests were significantly better in DLS compared to SLS (false discovery rate-adjusted p &lt;= .04). Overall, DLS alleviated the drift in circadian phase typically observed in space analog studies and reduced the prevalence of self-reported sleep episodes occurring at an adverse circadian phase. Our results support incorporating DLS in future missions, which may facilitate appropriate circadian alignment and reduce the risk of sleep disruption.</td>

      <td>The incidence of ulcer perforation in 1480 patients treated in the Bergen area of Norway between 1935 and 1990 was analyzed for daily (circadian), weekly (circaseptan), and yearly (circannual) time effects. A circadian rhythm was found overall that was reproducible and fairly stable across seasons, decades, and days of the week. After subgrouping, a circadian rhythm was found in younger patients, males, and duodenal perforations, while a 12 h (circasemidian) rhythm characterized ulcer perforation for women and for gastric ulcers. Duodenal perforations showed highest incidence in the afternoon, while gastric perforations showed a major peak around noon and a secondary peak near midnight. For duodenal ulcer perforation, the circannual pattern was characterized by a 6-month rhythm, with significantly higher incidence in May-June-July and in November-December in most subgroups. A circaseptan rhythm was not found, but there was a significantly higher incidence on Thursday-Friday as compared to Sunday-Monday. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the perforation of an ulcer thus seemed to show pronounced circadian and 6-month rhythmic variations, much less so circaseptan or circannual rhythms. While it is likely that exogenous environmental and/or societal factors play a significant role, variations in ulcer perforation may be related to endogenous biological rhythms in pathophysiological factors since the circadian pattern of duodenal perforation follows that for gastric acidity. Knowledge of the temporal patterns in peptic ulcer perforation and associated pathophysiologic factors should prove useful in optimizing the chronotherapeutic management of ulcer disease.</td>

      <td>Background: Headache is a leading reason for presentation to the emergency department (ED) with migraine being the most frequently headache. To ensure the adequate staffing of healthcare providers during peak times of headache visits, we analyzed the temporal distribution of emergency department visits in patients presenting with headache and/or migraine.Research design and methods: The authors conducted an ecological study, including all consecutive visits to the ED for headache. Patients were classified according to the IHS Classification. We analyzed circadian, circaseptan and circannual patterns for number of visits, comparing migraine patients with other headache patients.Results: There were 2132 ED visits for headache, including primary headache in 1367 (64.1%) cases; migraine in 963 (45.2%); secondary headache in 404 (18.9%); and unspecified headache in 366 (17.1%). The circadian pattern showed peaks around 11:00-13:00 and 17:00-19:00, with visits during the night shift 45% less frequent (p &lt; 0.001). The circaseptan pattern showed a peak on Monday-Tuesday and a low point on Sunday (p &lt; 0.007). The circannual pattern peaked in March and decreased in June.Conclusions: ED visits for headache showed specific circadian, circaseptan and circannual variations. No differences were found in these patterns when comparing migraine patients to other headache patients.</td>

      <td>An analogue of the periodogram method for unequally spaced data is presented with a view to resolving the frequency structure of the observations. The algorithm is explicitly based on the sequential least squares procedure. In particular, the key concept is that the within-plot spectral analysis can be augmented by the between-plot information to make inferences about common characteristics. It is also shown how the between-plot random variations can be incorporated into the multiple harmonic regression model. A detailed spectral analysis investigates the periodic fluctuations in four cardio-circulatory variables, measured by autorhythmometric observation by eight men at rest and extending over a time span of 2 years. The spectral curves show the existence of circadian and circaseptan rhythmicities. The amplitude modulation of the dian rhythm by circaseptan variation is assimilated with the rhythmicity of work during the week. The blood-pressure variables situate their maximum annual peak in the winter period. These quasi-periodic fluctuations appear to be related to the amount of physical activity performed in time by the subjects.</td>

      <td>A review of the scientific literature clarifies several chronobiological features of dreaming. The literature supports the conclusions that dreaming 'intensity' and, to a lesser extent dream-like quality, is modulated by (1) a sinusoidal, 90-min ultradian oscillation, (2) a 'switch-like' circadian oscillation, (3) a 12-h circasemidian rhythm, and (4) a 28-day circatrigintan rhythm (for women). Further, access to dream memory sources appears to be modulated by (5) a 7-day circaseptan rhythm. Further study of these rhythmic influences on dreaming may help to explain diverse and often contradictory findings in the dream research literature, to clarify relationships between dreaming and waking cognitive processes, to explain relationships between disturbed phase relationships and dream disturbances and to shed new light on the problems of dreaming's functions and biological markers. Further chronobiological studies of dreaming will likely enable the development of theoretical models that explain how interactions between and within major levels of oscillation determine the variable characteristics of dreaming.</td>

On a total of 451 cases, the age, sex, hour, day of the week and date of the attempted suicide have been recorded for each single case. The cosinor analysis for tau = 24 h has shown that a circadian periodicity is statistically significant both for the total of men (phi =-265 degrees +/- 17) and for the total women (phi =-285 degrees +/- 13), with p less than 0.01. The maximum incidence occurs during the later afternoon (approximately between 1700 and 1900). The results are similar to those obtained for the younger subjects only (up to 22 years), while for the following range of age, (22 to 40 years), and after 40 years, the rhythm is not so well demonstrable. As regards the circaseptan rhythm, it is quite evident for women, both up to 22 years (maximum incidence on Friday) and between 23 years and 40 years (maximum incidence Thursday), and from 40 years onwards, but it is not demonstrable for men. A circannual rhythm is demonstrable, on the contrary, both for men and women: the maximum incidence is in May for men and in February for women.</td>

Daily PR was collected from a middle-aged healthy working woman over one year. PR, SDNN index and sample entropy (SampEn) were chosen as the indexes of PR dynamics. In order to avoid interference from other biorhythms, ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method was used to decompose the original PR series into multiple components. And the single cosinor method was applied to fit the detrended component signal. An optimal 7-day period was found in all indexes (P = 0.0103, P = 0.0133, P = 0.0122 for PR, SDNN index and SampEn, separately) that demonstrated an underlying CS rhythm. In the following study, a statistical Monday decrease in PR dynamics was observed especially significant in the detrended signal. The results suggested a direct relationship between the Monday effect and the CS variation, and also indicated a cardiac susceptibility to the social activities. The findings in CS periodicity and the Monday effect may help understand the human's biorhythm, provide evidence for preventive and optimized timing treatment, and also serve to daily health management.</td>

Most studies have focussed upon circadian rhythms, but some circaseptan, circatrigintan, and circannual cycles have also been described. Rhythms may have an endogenous or an exogenous basis. Endogenous rhythms originate in the cells of the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Impulses from this region pass to the pineal gland, where they regulate the production of melatonin, a compound that modulates the sleep/wakefulness cycle. Endocrine, physiological, and psychological parameters all show evidence of periodicity. Most components of the immune system, both cellular and humoral, also show large rhythmic changes. It is not yet clear how far such periodicity is secondary to changes in other body systems. Nevertheless, the magnitude of variation is such that it is vital to obtain experimental and control data at identical time points in both acute and chronic studies of exercise and immune function. Disturbance of the sleep/wakefulness cycle can constitute a form of stress, with adverse consequence for immune function.</td>

      <td>The Derer's biological - cosmic week and the Halberg's circaseptan chronome Czechoslovak academician Ladislav Derer was born 115 years ago</td>
      <td>There are three common periodic intervals in the life of each human being from time immemorial: the day, the week and the year. The first one is given by the Earth's rotation, the latter one by its revolution around the Sun. These both do have clear biomedical counterparts. The 7-day week, basically linguistically period of change (or a similar period, e.g.10 days in Egypt or 8 days in Etrutria) was obviously originally considered mainly as a product of a societal agreement. Two groups of Czechoslovak clinicians-scientists, however, noted in forties of the XXth century an approximately week period in human laboratory data, after similar attempts abroad a few years earlier. In fifties, L.Derer, respecting the mathematical and biological principles in medicine and supported by the mathematician A.Hufa, demonstrated the presence of the 6-day rhythm in blood leukocyte counts in patients with leukemia, treated by cytostatics. Posing the question Where is it from?, he considered also cosmic influences but was unable to study this issue more deeply due to his premature decease. Two decades later, the Derer's circaseptans found wide confirmation not only in human medicine but also in biology. The pioneering role here belongs to Franz Halberg, USA, the godfather of the circadians (originally Halberg's paranoia) since the fifties. The possible geocosmic roots of circaseptans are supposed in the geomagnetic activity from interplanetary space, generating under the influence of the Sun rotation the periods around 6-7 days. This is presently documented, surprisingly, also by analysing the Derer's original data using more advanced, inferentially statistical method -the Halberg cosinor regression. Thus, the optimal approximation has been achieved for the period of 6.75 days the 4th harmonics of the Bartels solar rotation cycle. Accordingly, the week can be now, after Derer and Halberg, understood also same as day and year as a biological geocosmic phenomenon, a geomagnetic week, genetically acquired in the course of billions years' of evolution, encoded in our chronome. The personality of Ladislav Derer should, in the history of the Czech and Slovak biomedical sciences, be pernnanenly standing by such giants as the well known Jan Evangelista Purkyne (Purkinje) or as Bohumil Nemec, discoverer of the mechanism of positive geotropism of plant roots (Fig. 3, Ref. 28).

Daytime, night-time, and 24-h means served to identify dippers and non-dippers. Questionnaire-assessed depression and subjective quality of life were related to BP and HR by analyses of variance and linear regression. Statistical significance was at 5%.RESULTS: A circaseptan (about 7-day) component characterizes the 24-h mean and standard deviation (SD) of HR, and the daytime and day-night ratio of systolic BP. The SD of HR is higher on weekends and lower on Mondays and Thursdays. When awake, systolic BP is lowest on Sundays and the day-night ratio is optimal on weekends (Saturdays: 15.7 +/- 9.4%; Sundays: 14.0 +/- 13.2%). Depression was detected in 15 subjects, who had higher mean systolic and diastolic BP values (systolic BP: P = 0.028 Fridays, P = 0.021 Tuesdays; diastolic BP: P = 0.022 Mondays, P = 0.006 daytime Mondays) and a lower day-night ratio of diastolic BP (P = 0.012 Tuesdays, P = 0.005 Wednesdays, and P = 0.038 Thursdays). A depressive mood correlated positively with 24-h averages of systolic (P = 0.037) and diastolic (P = 0.030) BP.CONCLUSIONS: Depression (and subjective quality of life) can affect BP and HR variability. The results indicate the role that psychological factors may play in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Therapeutic implications are suggested for primary and secondary prevention.</td>

      <td>Reactive modifications of the autonomous time structure in the human organism.</td>
      <td>The spectrum of biological rhythms exhibits characteristic principles of biological time structure which also rule the functional behaviour. With increasing period lengths the rhythms become increasingly complex. In the long-wave section the rhythmic functions find their corresponding cycles in the environment, whereas the shorter waves represent only endogenous autonomous rhythms, which maintain an internal time order by means of frequency- and phase-coordination. Under resting conditions and in a state of complete adaptation only a few spontaneous rhythms dominate in the spectrum. However, under loading conditions as well as in pathological situations further periodicities come up. The spectrum of rhythms can be divided into certain blocks, with the period lengths predominating in each of these whole number frequency ratios forming a harmonic system. Frequency- and phase coordination establish a system of co-action which favours the functional economy of the organism. A tripartite organization of the autonomous rhythms involves different functional behaviours with regard to frequency, amplitude, and phase. Slower rhythms act upon the faster rhythms preferably by modulating their frequencies, while changes of the faster rhythms influence the slower ones by enhancing their amplitudes, multiplying their period lengths and shifting their phases. In principle the reactions of living systems are periodically structured. Reactive periodicity brings to appearance an endogenous time structure, which prefers whole number relationships with the spontaneous rhythms. The phase position of reactive periods depends on the stimulus. The amplitudes dampen down with increasing compensation. From the medical point of view so-called circaseptan (about 7 days) reactive periods are of predominant interest. This periodicity can be observed in numerous adaptive and compensating processes. It does not depend on the external week cycle and was already known to the antiquity.</td>

Similar patterns were observed for smoking cessation treatment seeking, such as calls to quitlines. These findings suggest that smoking cessation behaviors may have a weekly rhythm that could be leveraged to improve smoking cessation efforts.Aims: To assess whether weekly enrollment and usage patterns exist for an Internet smoking cessation intervention.Methods: We used process data from a large, longstanding Internet smoking cessation intervention (www.becomeanex.org). Pearson's chi-squared tests were performed to identify day-of-the week differences in enrollment, first visit to site community pages, and quit date. Differences were considered statistically significant at the 1% level if p &lt; 0.00167 due to multiple comparisons. Regression analysis was used to examine differences in engagement activity based on the day of the week a user enrolled.Results: Website users (n=69,237) were more likely to enroll on the site at the beginning of the week (Mondays and Tuesdays) (p &lt; 0.0001). Current smokers who selected quit dates (n =5574) preferred quit dates that came early in the week (Sundays and Mondays) compared to other weekdays (p &lt; 0.0001). Generally, there were no significant differences in overall website utilization metrics by day of enrollment, but there were some exceptions. Use of interactive features to select quit dates, track cigarette use, and record coping strategies was generally lower for Friday/Saturday enrollees.Conclusions: Consistent with prior research, the beginning of the week appears to be a time when individuals are more likely to enroll in an Internet smoking cessation intervention and engage with its core features. Emphasizing marketing and promotional efforts during the beginning of the week could result in greater reach of Internet smoking cessation interventions.</td>

      <td>Biological rhythms play a prominent role in the human life cycle. The endogenous rhythms are entrained by the environment and have an astronomical counterpart which is obvious for daily, monthly, and yearly rhythms, and may possibly also be present in weekly rhythms. Circadian rhythms are present in, e.g. testosterone levels, spontaneous birth, strokes, and death from cardiovascular causes. Circaseptan rhythms are present in, e.g. spontaneous birth, 17-ketosteroid levels, myocardial infarctions, and strokes. The relationship of these rhythms with the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) has not yet been established. Circatrigintan rhythms, such as the menstrual cycle, have so far not been associated with the SCN. Circannual rhythms are present in, e.g. mood, suicides, reproduction, birth weight, sleep and season of birth of psychiatric patients. The human SCN shows strong circadian and circannual fluctuations in the number of neurons expressing vasopressin. The vasopressin and VIP cell population of the SCN develop late, i.e. for a major part postnatally. After the age of 50 the amplitudes of circadian and circannual fluctuations of the vasopressin cell numbers are reduced whereas the number of vasopressin expressing neurons decreases after the age of 80 and do so even more and earlier in Alzheimer's disease. Sex differences are present in the shape of the vasopressin subnucleus of the SCN and in the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) cell number. The sex differences in the SCN, the doubling of the number of vasopressin neurons in the SCN of homosexual men, and a variety of animal experimental observations indicate that the SCN is involved in sexual behavior and reproduction. The exact role of the SCN in these processes is subject to current research.</td>

      <td>Chronobiology, the computer-aided science (logos) of life (bios) in time (chronos), provides novel concepts, tools and facts for those concerned with mitosis, growth and growth hormone (GH). GH concentrations in human plasma demonstrate a statistically significant circadian rhythm on a 6h as well as on a 24h rest-activity cycle. On a 24h routine of light (L) and darkness (D), alternating at 12h intervals, and in continuous D, circadian mitotic rhythms in mice persist as a feature of growth or regeneration. A circadian cell cycle commences with an increase in phospholipid labeling, followed by an increase in cytoplasmic RNA formation, preceding, in regular sequences, an increase in nuclear DNA formation and the next mitotic peak in those cells that are dividing in a growing or regenerating (reversibly post-mitotic') rodent liver. About 5-day (presumably estral) and about 7-day (circaseptan) components as well as circadians are resolved as a spectrum of mitotic rhythms in rodent cornea. The effects of hormones such as GH or a synthetic ACTH analogue, ACTH 1-17, depend upon the circadian cell cycle stages when the agent is administered. No effect or statistically significant effect can be the result only of 1) the timing of a fixed dose of GH or 2) of the timing of the samples taken to investigate any effect. For both the timing of administration and the assessment of effects, a multifrequency spectrum of rhythms, if taken into account, can provide (in lieu of a considerable and often formidable source of variation) a new critical dimension of growth and development.</td>

Most of the systems have been designed to measure only one or two variables. Because well-being is a combination of both psychological and physiological wellness, there is a need to monitor several psychophysiological variables simultaneously in out-of-hospital conditions for a long period. To understand better the variability of patients' wellness-related variables in long-term recordings, the knowledge of the normal variation in health-related variables in healthy people is necessary. In our study, 14 healthy working middle-aged men were studied daily for 24 h and periods of 50 to 79 days. The variables measured were beat-to-beat heart rate, motor activity, blood pressure, body weight, and temperature. At night respiratory frequency, time of movements, amount of quiet sleep, and ballistocardiographic respiratory variation were also measured. Heart rate variability in the waking period was calculated later (standard deviation of the 5 min average of the successive normal to normal beat to beat intervals). Daily self-reported well-being, activities, and consumption of alcohol were monitored by keeping a behavioral diary. After normalizing the physiological data, the diurnal and weekly variability was calculated for each variable. In several variables the most notable diurnal and weekly variability was found between working time and free time. In conclusion, diurnal and weekly rhythms in several wellness-related physiological and psychological variables were identified, depending on working and free-time in healthy middle-aged men.

Linear and multiple regressions were performed on the original data and the 24-hour means vs FM classifiers (age, disease duration, tender points, dolorimetry score, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire score), respectively. Data were analyzed for 24-hour and 7-day time-effects by ANOVA and for diurnal and weekly rhythms by the cosinor technique.RESULTS: Individual ratings for pain, stiffness, and fatigue correlated highly with each other throughout the day and over the days of the week. Of the FM classifiers, dolorimetry score was found to be inversely related to the pain, stiffness, and fatigue scores. For the group of subjects with a low dolorimetry score (&lt; 2.25 kg), a significant diurnal rhythm was found in each self-rated variable, with greater pain, stiffness, and fatigue observed in the morning and least in the late afternoon. No rhythm in pain or stiffness was observed in those subjects with a higher threshold for pain (dolorimetry score &gt; 2.25 kg), while fatigue showed the same significant diurnal pattern as in the first group. For the group as a whole, the possible presence of a weekly variation was found with ratings for pain, stiffness, and fatigue higher on Sunday and Monday and lower on Friday.CONCLUSION: Ratings of pain, stiffness, and fatigue in FM are significantly correlated, and show diurnal and possibly weekly rhythmicity, especially when pain threshold is low (dolorimetry score &lt; 2.25 kg), and are thus predictive of each other over these time spans. This has important implications for scheduling activities of daily living, for measurement in clinical trials, and possibly for timing the administration of medications.</td>

      <td>The 7-day cycle of human activities may lead to the weekend effect in climate variables and air pollutants. The weekend effect is defined as the average value (e.g., the diurnal temperature range) for Saturday through Monday minus the average value for Wednesday through Friday. A composite of the ground observations over northeastern China presents that, during 26-year (1980-2005) summers, the weekend effect in the diurnal temperature range increased by 1.2 degrees C. Conversely, the weekend effects in the relative humidity, cloud amount, and light rain (&lt;= 5 mm day(-1)) events decreased. These changes are due to a shifted phase of the weekly cycle of the meteorological variables. The long-term change in weekend effects have a high correlation coefficient (vertical bar r vertical bar approximate to 0.8) with the decrease in relative humidity over the region, which is likely induced by regional warming. The results suggest that regional warming is a possible factor in a transition of dominant aerosol effects in the weekend effect. Citation: Ho, C.-H., Y.-S. Choi, and S.-K.

In addition, B. bifidum CGMCC 15068 pre-treatment increased the relative abundance of Akkermansia, Desulfovibrionaceae, Romboutsia, Turicibacter, Verrucomicrobiaceae, Ruminococcaceae_UCG_013, Lachnospiraceae_UCG_004, and Lactobacillus. Meanwhile, B. bifidum CGMCC 15068 altered metabolites involved in the citrate cycle (TCA cycle), glycolysis, butyrate metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, and galactose metabolism. Several significant correlations were identified between the differentially abundant microbes and metabolites. These findings supported the beneficial role of B. bifidum CGMCC 15068 in intestinal health by modulating dysbiosis and the gut metabolic profile. The manipulation of the gut microbial composition using probiotics might be a promising prevention strategy for CRC. Long-term and large-scale clinical trials are warranted for the potential clinical applications of this strategy in the future.</td>

      <td>Prevention of antibiotic-associated metabolic syndrome in mice by intestinal alkaline phosphatase</td>
      <td>Aims: To examine whether co-administration of intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) with antibiotics early in life may have a preventive role against metabolic syndrome (MetS) in mice.Methods: A total of 50 mice were allocated to four treatment groups after weaning. Mice were treated with azithromycin (AZT) +/- IAP, or with no AZT +/- IAP, for three intermittent 7-day cycles. After the last treatment course, the mice were administered a regular chow diet for 5 weeks and subsequently a high-fat diet for 5 weeks. Body weight, food intake, water intake, serum lipids, glucose levels and liver lipids were compared. 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing was used to determine the differences in microbiome composition.Results: Exposure to AZT early in life rendered mice susceptible to MetS in adulthood. Co-administration of IAP with AZT completely prevented this susceptibility by decreasing total body weight, serum lipids, glucose levels and liver lipids to the levels of control mice. These effects of IAP probably occur as a result of changes in the composition of specific bacterial taxa at the genus and species levels (e.g. members of Anaeroplasma and Parabacteroides).Conclusions: Co-administration of IAP with AZT early in life prevents mice from susceptibility to the later development of MetS. This effect is associated with alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota. IAP may represent a novel treatment against MetS in humans.</td>

      <td>This study compares the response of Amaranthus candatus vegetable to root-to-shoot signals of soil drying and assesses applicability of the use of partial root zone drying (PRD) technique in increasing water-use efficiency. From a completely block randomized design, seeds were grown on three plots with each having three replicates. Three treatments were compared: half of the root system watered and half droughted by delivering 50% less crop water requirement (CWR) per irrigation depicted as 50%PRD; both halves of the root system received water application of 50% less crop water requirement per irrigation (50%CWR); while in the control treatment, both halves received 100% crop water requirement (100%CWR). The wetted and dried sides of the root system of 50%PRD were alternated on a 7-day cycle throughout experimental period. Effects of the differences in water-use on growth parameters, such as plant height, stem girth; number of leaves and leaf area were examined. Weights at harvest and root-to-shoot ratios were also compared. Drying half of the root system caused marked declines in all growth parameters in 50%CWR but only slight declines in 50%PRD. Since the main effect of water stress on Amaranthus is yield reduction, achieving better yields requires an optimum water supply from planting until ripening. Average edible wet weights (yields) of the 50%PRD and 50%CWR water applications when compared with the control were 81% and 25% respectively. The higher yield in 50%PRD may be attributed to high stomata sensitivity to drought signaling, as indicated by relatively low root to shoot ratio of 0.33. This lower ratio for 50%PRD treatment, compared to 50%CWR and 100%CWR with 0.40 and 0.66 values, was an indication of healthier and more profitable plants in 50%PRD because the decrease came from a greater shoot size.</td>

      <td>Background Biological rhythmicity has been extensively studied in animals for many decades. Although temporal patterns of physical activity have been identified in humans, no large-scale, multi-national study has been published, and no comparison has been attempted of the ubiquity of activity rhythms at different time scales (such as daily, weekly, monthly, and annual).Methods Using individually worn actigraphy devices, physical activity of 2,328 individuals from five different countries (adults of African descent from Ghana, South Africa, Jamaica, Seychelles, and the United States) was measured for seven consecutive days at different times of the year.Results Analysis for rhythmic patterns identified daily rhythmicity of physical activity in all five of the represented nationalities. Weekly rhythmicity was found in some, but not all, of the nationalities. No significant evidence of lunar rhythmicity or seasonal rhythmicity was found in any of the groups.Conclusions These findings extend previous small-scale observations of daily rhythmicity to a large cohort of individuals from around the world. The findings also confirm the existence of modest weekly rhythmicity but not lunar or seasonal rhythmicity in human activity. These differences in rhythm strength have implications for the management of health hazards of rhythm misalignment.</td>

      <td>Oscillatory Dynamics in Infectivity and Death Rates of COVID-19</td>
      <td>The analysis of systematically collected data for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infectivity and death rates has revealed, in many countries around the world, a typical oscillatory pattern with a 7-day (circaseptan) period. Additionally, in some countries, 3.5-day (hemicircaseptan) and 14-day periodicities have also been observed. Interestingly, the 7-day infectivity and death rate oscillations are almost in phase, showing local maxima on Thursdays/Fridays and local minima on Sundays/ Mondays. These observations are in stark contrast to a known pattern correlating the death rate with the reduced medical staff in hospitals on the weekends. While we cannot exclude the possibility that a significant portion of the observed oscillations is associated with the reporting of the individual cases, other reasons might contribute at least partly to these data. One possible hypothesis addressing these observations is that they reflect gradually increasing stress with the progressing week, which can trigger the higher death rates on Thursdays/Fridays. Moreover, assuming the weekends provide the likely time for new infections, the maximum number of new cases might fall, again, on Thursdays/Fridays. These observations deserve further study to provide a better understanding of COVID-19 dynamics.IMPORTANCE The infectivity and death rates for COVID-19 have been observed in many countries around the world as well as in the collective data of the whole world. These oscillations show distinct circaseptan periodicity, which could be associated with numerous biological reasons as well as with improper reporting of the data collected. Since very different results are observed in different countries and even continents, such as Sweden (very significant oscillations) or India (almost no oscillations), these data provide a very important message about different conditions under which the disease is spread or is reported, which, in turn, could serve as guidance tools in future epidemics. It is necessary that follow-up studies track the observed differences and fully reliably address their origins.</td>

For cancer chronotherapy (5-9), the analyses serve to suggest the desirability to extend the focus beyond circadian aspects of drug timing and drug effect to a broader view that takes into account as much of the body's make-up in time as is practical. Among the different components of a chronome (the time structure of rhythms with different frequencies and trends in a given variable), the 3.5-day patterns (circasemiseptans) and the 7-day patterns (circaseptans) are more readily accessible to measurement and thus to manipulation and optimization than infradians with even lower frequencies; they may also be pertinent to the scheduling of infusions covering several days, particularly those using drug administration devices, some of which are programmable. Should circaseptans and circasemiseptans characterize the host as well as the tumor, the drug administration schedule could be optimized for both treatment efficacy and host tolerance, with a view of infradian as well as of circadian and ultradian rhythms.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVES: To examine the circadian, seasonal, and weekly rhythms of acute myocardial infarction, and to identify subgroups in whom the rhythms are attenuated or absent to provide further information about the mechanisms of the rhythms and the processes responsible for triggering plaque events.DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective, observational study in a general hospital.PATIENTS AND METHODS: 1225 consecutive patients admitted to a coronary care unit with acute myocardial infarction were studied. Admission rates were calculated according to the hour of the day (circadian rhythm), day of the week (weekly rhythm), and month of year (seasonal rhythm). The data were analysed for variations within the whole group and within subgroups.RESULTS: A weekly rhythm of acute myocardial infarction could not be demonstrated but there was a trend towards higher admission rates at the beginning of the week. However, the time of onset of symptoms showed significant circadian variation for the group as a whole, peaking in the morning (P = 0.006), against an otherwise fairly constant background rate. Subgroup analysis showed complete absence of the circadian rhythm in patients who were diabetic, South Asian, or taking beta blockers or aspirin on admission. Significant seasonal variation in admission rates was also demonstrated for the group as a whole with a winter peak and a summer trough (P = 0.009). Again, no seasonal rhythm could be demonstrated in patients who were diabetic, South Asian, or taking beta blockers or aspirin on admission.CONCLUSIONS: The absence of circadian and seasonal rhythms of acute myocardial infarction in almost identical subgroups suggests that common mechanisms are involved in driving these rhythms. The autonomic nervous system is a likely candidate because the rhythms were absent in patients taking beta blockers as well as in patients in whom derangement of autonomic function commonly occurs.</td>

      <td>One of the key benefits in using chickens for immunization is the high yield of antibodies obtainable. It is known that egg production decreases over time, while animal maintenance costs remain stable. It would, however, be desirable to keep hens as long as possible to obtain maximal amounts of antibodies. To identify a suitable length of time that animals can be kept and to optimize the cost: yield ratio, we monitored the number of eggs laid, the total amount of chicken IgY, and the specific antibody titer from individually prepared eggs over a 2-yr period. The plant toxin ricin and the Clostridium botulinum neurotoxins type A and B were used to immunize 4 chickens. The number of eggs laid in 2 yr was approximately 600 per hen (about 80% of the maximum egg number), yielding about 20 to 40 g of total IgY per hen. A stable antibody titer of 1: 100,000 to 1: 1,000,000, as measured by ELISA, was obtained following up to 11 injections of 10 to 20 mu g of immobilized native toxin. Laying capacities were found to decrease, on average, from 7 eggs/wk at the point of first immunization to 2 eggs/wk after more than 2 yr. In parallel, the yield of total and specific IgY increased over time, so that the antibody recovery remained high, even after prolonged immunization times. Using purified IgY preparations, classical immunological assays such as ELISA and Western blotting were performed. Furthermore, the IgY showed neutralizing capacity when used to block the functional activity of the toxins both in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of the total IgY content over time demonstrated a complex biological oscillation (and the antigen-specific titer), with a shorter time period of around 7 d (circaseptan rhythm). In summary, we successfully immunized chickens with ricin and botulinum neurotoxins and monitored laying capacity, IgY concentration, and specific antibody titer over an extended period of 2 yr.</td>

      <td>Policymakers and researchers worldwide are interested in measuring the subjective well-being (SWB) of populations. In recent years, new approaches to measuring SWB have begun to appear, using digital traces as the main source of information, and show potential to overcome the shortcomings of traditional survey-based methods. In this paper, we propose the formal model for calculation of observable subjective well-being (OSWB) indicator based on posts from a social network, which utilizes demographic information and post-stratification techniques to make the data sample representative by selected characteristics of the general population. We applied the model on the data from Odnoklassniki, one of the largest social networks in Russia, and obtained an OSWB indicator representative of the population of Russia by age and gender. For sentiment analysis, we fine-tuned several language models on RuSentiment and achieved state-of-the-art results. The calculated OSWB indicator demonstrated moderate to strong Pearson's (r = 0.733, p = 0.007, n = 12) correlation and strong Spearman's (r(s) = 0.825, p = 0.001, n = 12) correlation with a traditional survey-based Happiness Index reported by Russia Public Opinion Research Center, confirming the validity of the proposed approach. Additionally, we explored circadian (24 h) and circaseptan (7 day) patterns, and report several interesting findings for the population of Russia. Firstly, daily variations were clearly observed: the morning had the lowest level of happiness, and the late evening had the highest. Secondly, weekly patterns were clearly observed as well, with weekends being happier than weekdays. The lowest level of happiness occurs in the first three weekdays, and starting on Thursday, it rises and peaks during the weekend. Lastly, demographic groups showed different levels of happiness on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis, which confirms the importance of post-stratification by age group and gender in OSWB studies based on digital traces.</td>

      <td>Current teaching states that when sodium intake is increased from low to high levels, total-body sodium (TBNa) and water increase until daily sodium excretion again equals intake. When sodium intake is reduced, sodium excretion briefly exceeds intake until the excess TBNa and water are eliminated, at which point sodium excretion again equals intake. However, careful balance studies oftentimes conflict with this view and long-term studies suggest that TBNa fluctuates independent of intake or body weight. We recently performed the opposite experiment in that we fixed sodium intake for several weeks at three levels of sodium intake and collected all urine made. We found weekly (circaseptan) patterns in sodium excretion that were inversely related to aldosterone and directly to cortisol. TBNa was not dependent on sodium intake but instead exhibited far longer (&gt;= monthly) infradian rhythms independent of extracellular water, body weight, or blood pressure. The findings are consistent with our ideas on tissue sodium storage and its regulation that we developed on the basis of animal research. We are implementing Na-23-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to pursue open questions on sodium balance in patients.

In enucleated cells, maxima were observed on shift schedules that were about 3-4 days rather than about 7 days apart.

The adjustment also differed among two members of the family.

By contrast, the husband delayed to achieve the same adjustment: his behavior was anticursive. The phenomenon of a difference in direction of adjustment for different variables in the same subject has been described earlier as polarity, now qualified as intra-individual polarity, to separate it from the precedent of an intrafamilial or more broadly inter-individual polarity or partitioning, reported apparently for the first time and dubbed 'cursion'.</td>

Information about the patients' professional occupation and typical sleeping rhythm was sought. Periodic signal components were identified in the amplitude spectrum, and their main characteristics were derived by cosinor analysis. The typical daily and weekly pattern were reconstructed by Fourier filtering.The Fourier spectrum indicates a strong circadian and a weaker circaseptan component in TI. The latter is significantly elevated in patients who regularly go to work, on error level p &lt; 0.05. Cosinor analysis states a significant circadian rhythm in all patients (p &lt; 0.001), with MESOR 61.8 Omega, amplitude 1.9 Omega, and acrophase 17.5 h. A significant weekly rhythm is found in 25 patients (p &lt; 0.05), with amplitude 0.31 Omega and acrophase typically on Wednesday. Both rhythms typically obtain their maximum during the 'active' phase of the period in daily life, i.e. in the afternoon and on working days, respectively, while the minimum is reached in the 'recreative' phase.Circadian and circaseptan variation are hence prevalent components of TI, which can induce impedance changes of several Ohms and thus be an error source for daily TI measurements.</td>

Symptom onset date was documented for all cases, and time to the nearest minute for 88%.INTERVENTIONSMyocardial infarctions with symptom onset on Christmas/New Year, Easter, and Midsummer holiday were identified. Similarly, myocardial infarctions that occurred during a FIFA World Cup, UEFA European Championship, and winter and summer Olympic Games were identified. The two weeks before and after a holiday were set as a control period, and for sports events the control period was set to the same time one year before and after the tournament. Circadian and circaseptan analyses were performed with Sunday and 24:00 as the reference day and hour with which all other days and hours were compared. Incidence rate ratios were calculated using a count regression model.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESDaily count of myocardial infarction.RESULTSChristmas and Midsummer holidays were associated with a higher risk of myocardial infarction (incidence rate ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.19, P&lt;0.001, and 1.12, 1.07 to 1.18, P&lt;0.001, respectively). The highest associated risk was observed for Christmas Eve (1.37, 1.29 to 1.46, P&lt;0.001). No increased risk was observed during Easter holiday or sports events. A circaseptan and circadian variation in the risk of myocardial infarction was observed, with higher risk during early mornings and on Mondays. Results were more pronounced in patients aged over 75 and those with diabetes and a history of coronary artery disease.CONCLUSIONSIn this nationwide real world study covering 16 years of hospital admissions for myocardial infarction with symptom onset documented to the nearest minute, Christmas, and Midsummer holidays were associated with higher risk of myocardial infarction, particularly in older and sicker patients, suggesting a role of external triggers in vulnerable individuals.</td>

Controlled variables were age, failure, sex, and day of test. The greatest percentage of the variance produced by the data was due to the age (typically 25%). The percentage attributable to the day of test (typically 5%) is hence masked by the variance due to the other factors. The method proposed herein makes it possible to isolate the percentage of the variance for the variable day of test alone and to provide evidence for a circaseptan effect on reaction time. It used a regressive correction on predominant variables. This effect shows performance is best on Thursday and weakest on Monday, the amplitude of the weekly rhythm being related to the task.</td>

      <td>The cosmos and CHAT, prompting blood pressure and heart rate monitoring for Derer's week.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The effects of natural environmental factors upon health, documented in Minnesota, support the proposition of Bratislava's champions of the cosmos and of the biological week, gauged via circaseptan rhythms by the late Ladislav Derer, whose macro-rhythm lasted most frequently about 6 days.MAIN PURPOSE: To introduce 7-day monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate into routine practice. STARTING POINTS AND METHODS: Cosinor analysis on 7-day series determines (conventionally ignored) consistent blood pressure overswinging, i.e., circadian hyper-amplitude-tension (CHAT), a disease risk syndrome, whether it is associated with a normal average blood pressure or a high blood pressure.RESULTS: Summary of information understandable by the general population on the dynamics of blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS AND MEANING FOR PRACTICE AND THEORY: Space weather reports may prompt preventive measures. Caution dictates in any event monitoring blood pressure and heart rate for 7 days to attempt to prevent strokes, rather than to ignore the greatest yet detectable risk of catastrophic vascular disease, CHAT, a risk greater than old age or high blood pressure.

      <td>About 7-day (circaseptan) and circadian changes in cold pressor test (CPT).</td>
      <td>We assess circadian (CD) and circaseptan (CS) changes in the blood pressure (BP) response to a 1-min immersion of the hand into ice water, the cold pressor test (CPT). An about 8 mmHg BP increase in the CPT reported by others for health and an elevation &gt;25 mmHg for patients with hypertension have been viewed as predisease, but variables related to the vascular system exhibit prominent CD, CS and circannuals, among other components of their genetically anchored time structure or chronome, and may also have to be considered. Hence, a 16-year-old adolescent (ML) immersed her hand into ice water every 2-4 h for 2 days and once daily in the morning thereafter for 1 week (N = 25), as did, only for &lt;2 days (&gt; or =24 h), four adults 20-66 years of age. BP and heart rate (HR) were monitored automatically around the clock at 15-min intervals and at 1-min intervals before and immediately after the CPT. Data were analyzed by cosinor. The difference between the first post-CPT BP value and the mean of the last seven values prior to the CPT was a measure of CPT response (at 1-min). Overall, ML's systolic (S) BP increased by 8.2 +/- 1.4 mmHg and her diastolic (D) BP by 6.2 +/- 0.9 mmHg (P &lt; 0.001). Increases were found in 96% of the tests for SBP, 92% for DBP and 20% for HR. There was only one tie for HR (4%), resulting in a HR decrease in 76% of CPTs. The BP response to CPT at 1 min was CS-dependent. The CS double amplitudes are 12.5 +/- 4.1 for SBP (P = 0.019) and 7.8 +/- 2.8 mmHg for DBP (P = 0.030), with acrophases occurring on late Sunday, early Monday (at -50 degrees and -67 degrees from 00:00 h from Saturday to Sunday for SBP and DBP, respectively, with 360 degrees identical with 1 week). The response of HR did not allow the detection of a CS rhythm (P = 0.969). The CD response peaked in the early morning hours; with 24 h identical with 360 degrees and 0 degrees = local midnight, the acrophase (phi) for SBP is at -80 degrees and for DBP at -113 degrees, in keeping with earlier results from four adult subjects (SBP: -37 degrees; DBP: -42 degrees ), individual differences notwithstanding. The average timing of the largest overall response of BP to CPT coincides with the timing of the response to other stimuli. The CS acrophases coincide with the times of increased morbidity/mortality from vascular diseases. Chronomes, time structures broader than circadian, notably their about-weekly components, should be considered, not only at the extremes of life when the CS and about-half-weekly rhythms are particularly prominent in BP and HR but also in interpreting BP responses as a gauge of vascular disease status in adolescents.</td>

      <td>IgY is the functional equivalent of mammalian IgG found in birds, reptiles and amphibians. Many of its biological aspects have been explored with different approaches. In order to evaluate the rhythmicity of serum and yolk IgY, four chickens were examined and reared under the same conditions. To monitor biological oscillations of IgY in yolk and serum, the eggs and blood samples were collected over a 60 day period and the rhythm of yolk and serum IgY was determined by direct-ELISA. Results indicated that, there is a significant circaseptan rhythm in yolk IgY and circaquattran rhythm in serum IgY. The serum IgY concentration reached a peak in the morning, decreased to a minimum during the daytime and increased again at night revealing a significant circadian rhythm was superimposed by an ultradian rhythm. These data are suited to address the controversies concerning the IgY concentration in egg yolk and blood of laying hens. In addition, this study raised new questions, if the different rhythms in yolk and serum are concerned. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

Only patients with a cardiac arrest of a cardiac aetiology and aged &gt; 18 years were included in the survey.RESULTS: 10,868 patients fulfilled inclusion criteria. In terms of the diurnal rhythm, there was a progressive increase in the development of cardiac arrest from 06:00 h, reaching a peak at about 10:00 h. Thereafter, there was a progressive decline until 05:00 h. The diurnal rhythm was more marked among patients aged &gt; 65 years and among patients in whom the arrest occurred outside home. There was a weekly rhythm with an increased incidence of cardiac arrest on Mondays. This was particularly evident among patients aged &lt; 66 years and among men. A cardiac arrest occurred most frequently in January and December. This was particularly observed in the large cities.CONCLUSION: We found that out of hospital cardiac arrest of a cardiac etiology has a diurnal, weekly and seasonal rhythm occurring most frequently in the morning hours, on Mondays and in December and January.

      <td>This study addressed two questions: Do daily fluctuations in mood exhibit a 7-day (circaseptum) cycle, and are there reliable individual differences in how entrained people's moods are to such a weekly cycle? Spectral analysis of daily mood over 84 occasions revealed a strong weekly rhythm in the temporal organization of mood in a sample of 74 undergraduates. A sine wave with a period of 7 days accounted for 40% of the variance in the daily mood data. Individual differences were also found in how entrained subjects' moods were to this weekly rhythm. We predicted that extraverts (compared with introverts) should be less entrained to a weekly cycle. Results suggest that the novelty- and sensation-seeking behavior of extraverts most likely serves to lessen the cyclical predictability of their day-to-day moods. The origin and psychological meaning of the 7-day week are discussed.</td>

Using a one-week time use survey held under couples in The Netherlands in 2003, the paper proposes indicators for measuring task allocation on a daily and weekly scale and investigates to what extent role expectations, work status and indicators of time pressure influence task allocation patterns. The outcomes suggest that egalitarian role expectations and higher female work status lead to a more balanced allocation of work and households tasks between spouses. More traditional role views and increased time pressure lead to more specialisation and inequality between spouses. Interestingly, households under time pressure apply day-to-day specialisation to arrive at balanced weekly allocation totals.</td>

      <td>Three different flow regimes were carried out in a pilot-scale horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland-treating sulfate rich wastewater contaminated with monochlorobenzene (MCB) and perchloroethene (PCE). The three regimes were continuous flow, 7-day cycle discontinuous flow, and 2.5-day cycle discontinuous flow. The results show that intensifying the tidal regime (2.5-day cycle) significantly enhanced MCB removal before 2 m from the inlet and increasing PCE removal efficiency at 0.5 m. The PCE dechlorination process was promoted with tidal operation, especially under the 2.5-day cycle regime, with significant increases of cis-1,2- dichloroethenes (DCEs), vinyl chloride (VC), and ethene, but trans-1,2-DCE was significantly decreased after tidal operation. Due to the high sulfate concentration in the influent, sulfide was observed in pore water up to 20 and 23 mg L-1 under continuous flow and 7-day cycle regime, respectively. However, sulfide concentrations decreased to less than 4 mg L-1 under intensified tidal operation (2.5-day cycle). The increase of oxygen concentration in pore water through intensified tidal operation resulted in better MCB removal performance and the successful inhibition of sulfate reduction. In conclusion, intensifying tidal operation is an effective approach for the treatment of chlorinated hydrocarbons and inhibiting sulfide accumulation in horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland.</td>

      <td>This paper proposes a partially periodic oscillation model, which is motivated by time series modelling for COVID-19 daily confirmed cases, in particular, to represent more accurately the dynamic features of the 7-day periodicity. In order to express the phenomenon of the partial 7-day cycle in the COVID-19 data, some partial periodic part is added to a heterogeneous autoregression model. Estimation algorithm based on the least squares errors and regression analysis is provided and parameter estimation consistency is given along with its proof. A Monte-Carlo simulation study is carried out to investigate the finite-sample performance. The proposed model is applied to the COVID-19 daily confirmed cases of the most affected eight countries which posses the partially periodic oscillation. Model criteria such as RMSE, MAE, HMAE, AIC and BIC are compared with other existing models. Efficiency of the model, relative to the benchmark, is evaluated to reveal its better accuracy performance. Out-of-sample forecasting analysis is conducted as well. The novelty is that this work is a challenging trial to identify the partially periodic oscillation of COVID-19 data, without smoothing, as well as the proposed model outperforms the existing time series models in the empirical analysis of the worldwide COVID-19.</td>

      <td>Urban water demand (UWD) is highly dependent on interacting natural and socio-economic factors, and thus a wide range of data analysis and forecasting methods are required to fully understand the issue. This study applies, for the first time, the continuous wavelet transform to determine changes in the temporal pattern of UWD and its potential meteorological drivers for three major Canadian cities: Calgary, Montreal, and Ottawa. This analysis is complemented by Fourier and cross-spectral analysis to determine inter-relationships and the significance of the patterns detected. The results show that the annual (365 days) cycle provides the most consistent and significant relationship between UWD and meteorological drivers. Wavelet analysis shows that UWD is only sensitive to air temperature in the summer months when mean daily temperatures are greater than 10 to 12 A degrees C. For the three cities studied, the UWD increases by between 10 ML (Montreal) and 50 ML (Calgary) per day with every 1 A degrees C increase in air temperature. In an area with low precipitation (Calgary), there is an inverse relationship between UWD and precipitation during summer months. Wavelet transform and Fourier analysis also detected a 7-day cycle in UWD, particularly in the more industrialized city of Montreal, which is related to the working week. In general, applying the season dependent linear relationships between UWD and temperature is suggested as perhaps being more appropriate and potentially successful for forecasting, rather than continuous complex nonlinear algorithms that are designed to explain variability in the entire UWD record.</td>

This prototype would help to identify the barriers to and facilitators of active living in individuals older than 55 years. A prototype of the intervention was co-designed by a community of stakeholders in Barcelona who were familiar with the social and economic burden of aging in high-income societies. The app's functionalities included recommendations for healthy routes in the city (parks, pedestrian lanes, and streets) according to environmental variables (air quality and climate) and personal preferences (route difficulty, distance, and geolocation), and ecological momentary assessments (pictures and voice notes) were collected to identify the barriers to and facilitators of performing these routes. To test the app, a pilot study was conducted over two 7-day cycles with citizen scientists recruited at the life-long learning centers of two deprived neighborhoods in Barcelona. A total of 21 citizen scientists (mean age = 67 (standard deviation = 7)), 86% of them female, collected 112 comments and 48 pictures describing their perceived barriers to and facilitators of active living. Every Walk You Take is a new, validated, and sustainable mHealth intervention that is directly involved in health promotion, as it empowers the citizens of Barcelona to play an active role in their own healthcare. This intervention has the potential to be implemented in different cities around the world to collect information on the community determinants of health and health assets.</td>

      <td>A 7-day cycle is a special time-scale that corresponds with the weekly working schedule. However, there is no consensus on the existence of the weekly cycle of aerosol loading, which is closely related to human activities. In the present study, we analyzed the surface concentration of PM10 (Particulate Matter with a diameter of less than 10 pm) and other physically linked variables over Southeastern China under calm weather conditions to detect signs of the aerosol loading weekly cycle. Results show that the weekly cycle of PM10 is distinct; the maximum occurs on Thursday and the minimum occurs on Saturday and Sunday. The range of this cycle is over 8 mu g m(-3), approximately 8% of the daily average. The existence of the PM10 weekly cycle was supported by the pronounced amplitude of the 7-day cycle compared with those of 6-day and 8-day cycles and by significant results from the Monte-Carlo test. There are also distinct weekly cycles in the directly linked variables of adjusted horizontal visibility, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2); the patterns of these cycles are corresponding with that of PM10. The changes of total cloud cover and relative humidity on the weekly time-scale were analyzed, and the relationship with PM10 was discussed. It is likely that the cloud cover weekly cycle is conducted by the change of PM10 through the semi-direct aerosol effect We also found that precipitation and wind might weaken the PM10 weekly cycle by scavenging the heavy aerosol loading.

All patients were retired, with no work responsibilities, and lived--closely-supervised in a home for the aged--on a routine that provided little differences between weekdays and weekends. Cardiac mortality showed a circadian variation, with a peak in the early morning hours, coinciding with the circadian peak in systolic and diastolic blood pressures. A weekly (circaseptan) variation in cardiac mortality was found, with the greatest number of patients dying on Mondays and the least on Thursdays. There were seasonal differences in cardiac mortality, with a peak in July and a broader peak during the cold season (December to February). The former coincides with the circannual peak in diastolic blood pressure, but is unrelated to the seasonal variation in norepinephrine excretion. Circadian, circaseptan, and circannual variations in cardiac mortality appear to be the expression of time-dependent, transient risk states for catastrophic cardiac events, which may lend themselves to preventive treatment.</td>

      <td>Reactive modifications of the autonomous time structure of biological functions in man.</td>
      <td>The spectrum of biological rhythms exhibits characteristic principles of biological time structure which also rule the functional behaviour. With increasing period lengths the rhythms become increasingly complex. In the long-wave section the rhythmic functions find their corresponding cycles in the environment, whereas the shorter waves represent only endogenous autonomous rhythms, which maintain an internal time order by means of frequency- and phase-coordination. Under resting conditions and in a state of complete adaptation only a few spontaneous rhythms dominate in the spectrum. However, under loading conditions as well as in pathological situations further periodicities come up. The spectrum of rhythms can be divided into certain blocks, with the period lengths predominating in each of these whole number frequency ratios forming a harmonic system. Frequency- and phase-coordination establish a system of co-action which favours the functional economy of the organism. A tripartite organization of the autonomous rhythms involves different functional behaviours with regard to frequency, amplitude, and phase. Slower rhythms act upon the faster rhythms preferably by modulating their frequencies, while changes of the faster rhythms influence the slower ones by enhancing their amplitudes, multiplying their period lengths and shifting their phases. In principle the reactions of living systems are periodically structured. Reactive periodicity brings to appearance an endogenous time structure, which prefers whole number relationships with the spontaneous rhythms. The phase position of reactive periods depends on the stimulus. The amplitudes dampen down with increasing compensation. From the medical point of view so-called circaseptan (about 7 days) reactive periods are of predominant interest. This periodicity can be observed in numerous adaptive and compensating processes. It does not depend on the external week cycle and was already known to the antiquity.</td>

BP is never a constant true (resting) value and can be more reliably diagnosed by CABPM 7d/24h as MESOR-hypertension, MH. CHAT carries a risk of hard events greater than MH and can be treated, among other VVDs, which if they coexist constitute vascular variability syndromes (VVSs). A project on The BIOsphere and the COSmos, BIOCOS (corne001@umn.edu), provides, in exchange for the data, cost-free analyses and the opportunity of obtaining monitors at a cost reduction of 80%. Biospheric monitoring complements, the records from purely physical tools for surveilling the variable Sun, by validating in the biosphere the reality of intermittent, aeolian environmental spectral components that can be more consistent than their physical counterparts once they are coded in genes. C-ABPA4 7D/24H indicates relevant associations of space weather with human health and ecology.Monitoring reveals, around and in living matter, a system of transdisciplinary cycles with common average periods, quantified with point-and-interval estimates of parameters. The cycles in space climate are critical in discussing global warming. The cycles' periods are described as congruent when their CIs (95% confidence intervals) overlie or overlap and the amplitudes' CIs' lower limits are positive. Some congruent cycles in organisms, counterparts of the environmental day and the seasons, relate to electron magnetic radiation in the visible domain; these are the usually environmentally synchronized socio-photo-thermoperiodisms (photics). The biosphere also resonates with or is pulled or driven by nonstationary, environmental nonphotic cycles (nonphotics) - particle emissions from the sun and the wider cosmos, cosmoheliogeomagnetics, ultraviolet flux, gravitation, acoustics and others. Non-photics, a set of in part transdisciplinary-novel spectral components, can be intermittent; when present, they coexist and compete with signatures of photic cycles, monitored, e.g., in BP and HR. Nonphotics of, e.g., about (similar to) 1 week (circaseptans) and similar to 17 months (transyears), characterize mood and performance, modulate and sometimes override society's (phctic) schedules, even in dying suddenly either unintentionally or by one's own will or at the hand of others. Nonphotics persist, but are damped in physiology or in terrorism, when their environmental counterpart is not detected. Their elucidation provides information on how a set of cycles covering 18 orders of magnitude in the frequency domain of the biosphere bears on the question What is life?: a resonance of the biosphere with periods of its environment constitutes life itself.</td>

In addition to circadians, a circaseptan pattern characterizes the duration of ischemia in all three aforementioned study stages. Both drugs decrease the duration of ischemia, atenolol, but not diltiazem, also affects the circadian amplitude and acrophase of this variable.

Both drugs lower heart rate and the circadian amplitude and 24-h standard deviation of heart rate, atenolol much more markedly than diltiazem. Circadian and circaseptan rhythm characteristics and their alterations with treatment serve to optimize treatment by timing its administration. Chronobiologic surveillance of variables that are being readily monitored as-one-goes by modern implantable devices can also serve for the validation of the effectiveness of drug and electrical therapy.

Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus LS8 (LRL) is a potential gut microbiota regulating strain because it can produce a novel antimicrobial substance (like cycloalanopine). In addition, this probiotic had an inflammation-ameliorating effect on the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice. However, it is not known whether treatment with this probiotic could ameliorate colitis-associated CRC via regulating gut microbiota. In this study, a CRC mouse model was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of azoxymethane (AOM, 10 mg/kg) and followed by three 7-day cycles of 2% DSS administration. Results showed that LRL could inhibit tumor formation. Moreover, LRL enhanced the gut barrier by preventing goblet cell loss and promoting the expression of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1. Furthermore, LRL ameliorated gut microbiota dysbiosis, which was conducive to the growth of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Faecalibaculum and Akkermansia), and further led to an increase in SCFAs and a decrease in LPS. In addition, LRL alleviated colonic inflammation by inhibiting the overexpression of TLR4/NF-kappa B, pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-gamma, and IL-17a), and chemokines (Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Cxcl3, Cxcl5, and Cxcl7). In conclusion, LRL could alleviate CRC by regulating gut microbiota and preventing gut barrier damage and inflammation.</td>

      <td>Human activities follow daily, weekly, and seasonal rhythms. The emergence of these rhythms is related to physiology and natural cycles as well as social constructs. The human body and its biological functions undergo near 24-h rhythms (circadian rhythms). While their frequencies are similar across people, their phases differ. In the chronobiology literature, people are categorized into morning-type, evening-type, and intermediate-type groups called chronotypes based on their tendency to sleep at different times of day. Typically, this typology builds on carefully designed questionnaires or manually crafted features of time series data on people's activity. Here, we introduce a method where time-stamped data from smartphones are decomposed into components using non-negative matrix factorization. The method does not require any predetermined assumptions about the typical times of sleep or activity: the results are fully context-dependent and determined by the most prominent features of the activity data. We demonstrate our method by applying it to a dataset of mobile phone screen usage logs of 400 university students, collected over a year. We find four emergent temporal components: morning activity, night activity, evening activity and activity at noon. Individual behavior can be reduced to weights on these four components. We do not observe any clear categories of people based on the weights, but individuals are rather placed on a continuous spectrum according to the timings of their phone activities. High weights for the morning and night components strongly correlate with sleep and wake-up times. Our work points towards a data-driven way of characterizing people based on their full daily and weekly rhythms of activity and behavior, instead of only focusing on the timing of their sleeping periods.</td>

This study extends incivility theory and research by applying latent growth curve (LGC) modeling to diary study data to understand day-to-day changes in incivility.Design: The authors took a theory-driven approach, reviewing both mood and recovery theory that would support a decrease in incivility over the working week.Methods: Diary survey methodology was used, with a morning and evening survey completed on five consecutive workdays by 171 (73% of the 235 who initially volunteered, 95% of those who completed any surveys) employees in the legal industry. LGC analysis was used to identify patterns of experienced incivility, mood (both measured after work), and recovery (assessed the following morning).Results: Regardless of job demands and gender, a weekly pattern was identified with the likelihood of experiencing incivility (coded as 0 = none, 1 = some) decreasing from Monday to Friday by .78 each day (p &lt; .001) in a relatively linear fashion with a slope factor of .34 (SE = 0.23; p &gt; .05), indicating invariance between individuals. This weekly pattern was not explained by changes in mood or recovery.Conclusions: Results emphasize the impact of contextual factors such as time on workplace incivility and the need to consider weekly rhythms of other behaviors that are likely to affect employee well-being and productivity.

      <td>MAPPING OF CIRCASEPTAN AND CIRCADIAN CHANGES IN MOOD.</td>
      <td>Circadian changes in mood have been described earlier. A positive affect (PA) has been separated from a negative affect (NA), as independent components in opposite admittedly subjective directions, a circadian rhythm characterizing both aspects. Herein, the time structure (chronome) of human mood is re-examined and extended from the circadian to the circaseptan domain by a meta-analysis of data on 196 clinically healthy students who filled out the positive (PA) and negative (NA) affective scale (PANAS), consisting each of 10-item mood scales. Both PA and NA are found by cosinor to be characterized by a circaseptan, circasemiseptan, and circadian variation. The circaseptan and circasemiseptan amplitudes are found to be larger than the circadian amplitude for NA, whereas the circadian amplitude is largest for PA. Complementing differences in relative circaseptan-to-circadian prominence between PA and NA are differences in the timing of the circadian, circasemiseptan, and circaseptan components of PA and NA. An even broader spectrum of rhythms may include a circadecadal modulation. With this qualification, the information on the time structure of mood provides endpoints to be considered in any attempt to optimize psychological well-being by making sleeping, dietary, and/or other lifestyle adjustments.</td>

Design: Cross-sectional study. Subjects: A total of 35,940 European and North American women aged 18-40 - 40 years. Exposure: Data were collected in real-life conditions. Intervention: No intervention was performed. Main Outcome Measure: The onset of menstruation was assessed in prospectively measured menstrual cycles (311,064 cycles) over 3 full years (2019-2021). - 2021). Associations were calculated between the onset of menstruation and the day of the week, and between the onset of menstruation and the lunar phase. Results: In this large data set, a circaseptan (7-day) rhythmicity of menstruation was observed, with a peak (acrophase) of menstrual onset on Thursdays and Fridays. This circaseptan rhythm was observed in every age group, in every phase of the lunar cycle, and in all seasons. This feature was most pronounced for cycle durations between 27 and 29 days. In winter, the circaseptan rhythm was found in cycles of 27-29 - 29 days, but not in other cycle lengths. A circalunar rhythm was also statistically significant, fi cant, but not as clearly defined fi ned as the circaseptan rhythm. The peak (acrophase) of the circalunar rhythm of menstrual onset varied according to the season. In addition, there was a small but statistically significant fi cant interaction between the circaseptan rhythm and the lunar cycle. Conclusion: Although relatively small in amplitude, the weekly rhythm of menstruation was statistically significant. fi cant. Menstruation occurs more often on Thursdays and Fridays than on other days of the week. This is particularly true for women whose cycles last between 27 and 29 days. Circalunar rhythmicity was also statistically significant. fi cant. However, it is less pronounced than the weekly rhythm. (Fertil Steril (R) (R) 2024;121:651-9.

      <td>Striae periodicity refers to the number of cross-striations between successive lines of Retzius in tooth enamel. A regular time dependency of striae periodicity, known as the circaseptan interval, has been proposed. Previous studies on striae periodicity have been carried out on both modern and early humans given its potential applications in forensic age estimations and anthropology. Nevertheless, research comparing striae periodicities across gender groups and populations in different geographical locations, particularly in Asia, is lacking. In this study, we compared the striae periodicities of Heilongjiang and Singaporean Chinese, as well as that of Singaporean Chinese males and females. Results showed that while the median striae periodicity counts of Heilongjiang Chinese and Singaporean Chinese teeth are both 7, Heilongjiang Chinese tend to have lower striae periodicity counts than Singaporean Chinese (p &lt; 0.01). No significant gender difference was observed between the median striae periodicity of Singaporean Chinese Female and Singaporean Chinese Male teeth (p = 0.511). We concluded that the median striae periodicity may statistically differ with geographical location, but not gender, provided that ethnicity and geographical location are held constant. Further studies are required to examine the causes for variation in striae periodicities between geographical locations, as well as to verify the other bio-environmental determinants of striae periodicity.</td>

Recipients of cadaver donor kidneys were divided into four subgroups: with and without postoperative acute renal failure (ARF), and with and without approximately two weeks of immunosuppression by antilymphoblast globulin (ALG) added to conventional therapy. All recipients with immediate function without ALG showed evidence of periodicity in probability of occurrence of rejection that was highly significant for a 7-day period beginning at the time of surgery. The remaining groups showed less significant periodicity or no significant periodicity beginning at the time of surgery, but they did show a highly significant circaseptan rhythm of rejection episodes beginning with cessation of ALG treatment or with onset of diuresis following ARF in the absence of ALG. It is suggested that clinical manifestation of the immunologic attack of recipient upon graft has an intrinsic development period of about 7 days beginning with implantation.

      <td>The steady-state concept of Na+ homeostasis, based on short-term investigations of responses to high salt intake, maintains that dietary Na+ is rapidly eliminated into urine, thereby achieving constant total-body Na+ and water content. We introduced the reverse experimental approach by fixing salt intake of men participating in space flight simulations at 12 g, 9 g, and 6 g/day for months and tested for the predicted constancy in urinary excretion and total-body Na+ content. At constant salt intake, daily Na+ excretion exhibited aldosterone-dependent, weekly (circaseptan) rhythms, resulting in periodic Na+ storage. Changes in total-body Na+ (+/- 200-400 mmol) exhibited longer infradian rhythm periods (about monthly and longer period lengths) without parallel changes in body weight and extracellular water and were directly related to urinary aldosterone excretion and inversely to urinary cortisol, suggesting rhythmic hormonal control. Our findings define rhythmic Na+ excretory and retention patterns independent of blood pressure or body water, which occur independent of salt intake.</td>

      <td>Lunar influence on atrial fibrillation?</td>
      <td>The most popular periodicities in biology and medicine-the circadians and circannuals-stem undoubtedly from the Earth's rotation and its revolution around the sun. The problem is how to explain the existence of circaseptan, i.e. 5-9-day, and other infradian rhythms. They may correspond to the lunar cycles and their 2nd to 6th harmonics. To test such hypothesis, the calendar dates of 127 attacks of atrial fibrillation in one male subject (M.M.) between 1980 and 1994 were transformed into the days numbered 0-29 for the synodic, and 0-26 for tropic lunar cycle. The daily frequencies obtained in this way were smoothed by moving averages of three successive days each. Considerable fluctuations of frequencies of attacks during both cycles were visible by inspection of the corresponding graphs, called lunar plexograms. Thus, a conspicuous nadir is found under the full moon in the synodic cycle, and a marked peak shortly after the extreme southern position of the moon in the tropic cycle. Halberg's cosinor analysis testing the presence of the 1st to 6th harmonic of either lunar cycle rejected the null hypothesis at the alpha = 0.05 level for all harmonics. Accordingly, the occurrence of attacks was cycling with the period lengths of synodic and tropic lunar cycles, and with those of their 1/2-1/6 period lengths, i.e. with a cluster of approximately circa(di)-septan rhythms. This conclusion is supported by similar findings obtained earlier for various medical and biological events.</td>

The circadian staging of the rhythms in vascular, cellular, and coagulation factors that favors blood coagulation and thrombosis coincides with the daily minimum in fibrinolytic activity; as a result there is elevated risk in the morning of acute myocardial infarction and stroke. Similar hemostatic rhythms may determine the epidemiology of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events during the week, month and year.

During the last 10 years, measurements of lower leg length (knemometry) have been performed with a significantly lower technical error (0.09-0.16 mm). Repeated determinations of lower leg length at short intervals are now feasible, and evidence indicates that short term growth is a phenomenon that includes both length increment and decrement. At measurement intervals of exactly 1 week, growth appears periodic showing marked spurts that alternate with intervals of decreased growth velocity with a peak-to-peak distance of 30-55 days (mini growth spurts). These spurts have significant clinical importance and can be used as predictive criteria for successful growth promotion in growth hormone therapy of short stature.

      <td>It is well known that some signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) vary within a day and between days, and the morning stiffness observed in RA patients has become one of the diagnostic criteria of the disease. Research carried out in the last 10 years confirmed these clinical observations, and circadian, circaseptan or circannual variations were detected in experimental inflammation and in patients with arthritis diseases. The human data showed also that large interindividual differences can be found in the symptoms of RA. The chronopharmacological studies carried out with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) revealed circadian and circannual variations in the effectiveness, toxicity and pharmacokinetics of NSAID. A review of the available data suggests that peak and trough values found in different arthritic diseases do not occur at the same hour of the day and that the side effects produced by NSAID are more important after the morning than the evening administration. This information should be used by clinicians to determine when to administer drugs to arthritic patients, to optimize the effectiveness of NSAID and/or to reduce the side effects of these drugs. These new data could also be useful to physicians who would like to individualize NSAID use in patients with different arthritic diseases.</td>

The circulating formed elements in the peripheral blood show highly reproducible circadian rhythms. The timing and the extent of these rhythms were established in a clinically healthy human population and are shown as chronograms, cosinor summaries and, for some high-amplitude rhythms, as time-qualified reference ranges (chronodesms). Not only the number but also the reactivity of circulating blood cells varies predictably as a function of time as shown for the circadian rhythm in responsiveness of human and murine lymphocytes in vitro to lectin mitogens (phytohemagglutinin and pokeweed mitogen). Some circadian rhythms of hematologic functions appear to be innate and are presumably genetically determined but are modulated and adjusted in their timing by environmental factors, so-called synchronizers. Phase alterations in the circadian rhythms of hematologic parameters of human subjects and of mice by manipulation of the activity-rest or light-dark schedule and/or of the time of food uptake are presented. Characteristically these functions do not change their timing immediately after a shift in synchronizer phase but adapt over several and in some instances over many transient cycles. The circadian rhythm of cell proliferation in the mammalian bone marrow and lymphoid system as shown in mice in vivo and in vitro may lend itself to timed treatment with cell-cycle-specific and nonspecific agents in an attempt to maximize the desired and to minimize the undesired treatment effects upon the marrow. Differences in response, and susceptibility of cells and tissues at different stages of their circadian and circaseptan (about 7-day) rhythms and presumably of cyclic variations in other frequencies are expected to lead to the development of a chronopharmacology of the hematopoietic and immune system. Infradian rhythms of several frequencies have been described for numerous hematologic and immune functions. Some of these, i.e., in the circaseptan frequency range, seem to be of importance for humoral and for cell mediated immune functions including allograft rejection. Infradian rhythms with periods of 19 to 22 days seem to occur in some hematologic functions and are very prominent in cyclic neutropenia and (with shorter periods) in its animal model, the grey collie syndrome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</td>

Results: Cancer patients under pure radiotherapy have a comparable humoral vaccination response and long-term persistency of antibodies to healthy controls. Patients receiving additional chemotherapy show a significantly delayed immune response and decreased antibody titers. The vaccine was well tolerated in all cohorts. Conclusions: Pure radiotherapy in cancer patients does not interfere with the vaccine-induced humoral immune response or other immunogenetic aspects, whereas previous or simultaneous chemotherapy does. Findings are of particular relevance for future epidemic or pandemic scenarios.</td>

      <td>Seasonal daily effect on the number of births in Israel.</td>
      <td>Previous studies have observed a 7-day cycle with the least number of births occurring on Sundays. This study was aimed at characterizing the daily effect on the number of births in Israel, where Sunday is a regular working day and Saturday is a nonworking day. It was hypothesized that fewer births would be noted on Saturday rather than Sunday and fewer births on Jewish holidays. The data consisted of a random sample of live births during 1975. A robust time series procedure was used for the data analysis. As expected, the number of births was much smaller on Saturdays than on other weekdays (10% reduction). The seasonal component for Sundays was greater than that for any other day due to births delayed from Saturday and scheduled induced births. The number of births was not reduced as much on Saturdays during spring and summer as during fall and winter. In addition, fewer births occurred on most Jewish holidays. However, an unexpected and extremely high number of births was noted on Yom Kippur and the day after. It is speculated that the strain and fasting during this holiday promoted labor induction. In 21 of the 52 weeks in the study period, the least number of births occurred on a Saturday, and the number of births was less than the mean of the remaining 6 days in 46 of these weeks. Similarly, in 17 of the 52 weeks, the greatest number of births occurred on a Sunday, and the Sunday births exceeded the mean of Monday-Friday births in 35 of these weeks. Thus, these results confirm the study hypothesis and are believed to reflect intervention in childbirth.</td>

      <td>Purpose Gut microbiota has been reported to contribute to either prevent or promote colorectal cancer (CRC), and treatment with probiotics might be a promising intervention method. The present study aimed to evaluate the potential anti-CRC effects of Lactobacillus coryniformis MXJ32 on a colitis-associated (CA)-CRC mouse model.Methods The CA-CRC mouse model was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/kg azoxymethane and followed by three 7-day cycles of 2% dextran sulfate sodium in drinking water with a 14-day recovery period. Mice were supplemented with L. coryniformis MXJ32 by oral gavage (1 x 10(9) CFU/day/mouse). The CA-CRC attenuating effects of this probiotic were assessed via intestinal barrier integrity, inflammation, and gut microenvironment.Results Treatment with L. coryniformis MXJ32 could significantly inhibit the total number of tumors and the average tumor diameter. This probiotic administration prevented the damage of intestinal barrier function by enhancing the expression of tight junction proteins (Occludin, Claudin-1, and ZO-1) and recovering the loss of goblet cells. Moreover, L. coryniformis MXJ32 alleviated intestinal inflammation via down-regulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-gamma, and IL-17a) and chemokines (Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Cxcl3, Cxcl5, and Ccl7). In addition, L. coryniformis MXJ32 supplementation increased the abundance of some beneficial bacteria (such as SCFAs-producing bacteria, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia, and Faecalibaculum) and decreased the abundance of some harmful bacteria (such as pro-inflammatory bacteria, Desulfovibrio and Helicobacter), which in turn attenuated the overexpression of inflammation.Conclusion Lactobacillus coryniformis MXJ32 could effectively ameliorate CA-CRC via regulating intestinal microenvironment, alleviating inflammation, and intestinal barrier damage, which further suggested that L. coryniformis MXJ32 could be considered as a functional food ingredient for the alleviation of CA-CRC.[GRAPHICS]</td>

      <td>About-Weekly Pattern in the Dynamic Complexity of a Healthy Subject's Cellular Immune Activity: A Biopsychosocial Analysis</td>
      <td>In a previous integrative single-case study, we collected biological, psychological and social time-series data on a 25-year-old healthy woman over the course of 126 12-h intervals (63 days) and used urinary neopterin as an indicator of cellular immune activity [Schubert et al. 2012 (1)]. The present re-evaluation introduced Dynamic Complexity (DC) as an additional non-linear and non-stationary measure to further investigate the subject's biopsychosocial dynamics during the study. The new time series dealing with urinary neopterin complexity revealed a cyclic, circaseptan (about-weekly) repeating pattern (6.59 days). The only weekly reoccurring events over the course of the study that were associated with this immunological pattern were the in-depth interviews with the subject (mean distance between interviews: 6.5 days). Superposed epoch analysis (SEA) revealed a U-shaped relation between neopterin complexity and interviews, with a decrease in neopterin complexity before and during interviews and an increase after interviews. Furthermore, the complexity scores for irritation, anxiousness/depressiveness and mental activity were positively correlated with neopterin complexity. The results suggest that the interviews, which had been found to be related to the subject's need for educational and/or social accomplishment, were marked by stress (decrease in psycho-immunological flexibility and adaptability), which was then relieved after the interviews (increase in psycho-immunological flexibility and adaptability). It appears that the subject's cellular immune activity, as indicated by neopterin complexity, functionally mirrored the emotional meaning she ascribed to the in-depth interviews. This re-evaluation is in line with the view that biopsychosocial research requires multimodal analysis of single cases based on qualitative (e.g., in-depth interviews) and quantitative (e.g., time series analysis) data under conditions of life as it is lived .</td>

      <td>A built-in (genetically determined) about-7-day (circaseptan) period comes to the fore as a desynchronized feature of human time structure in the urinary excretion of 17-ketosteroids by a clinical healthy man: during several years following an endocrine intervention (the self-administration of testosterone suppositories), a circaseptan rhythm (which during the preceding decade had revealed a period of precisely 7 days) deviated slightly, yet with statistical significance, from the environmental week. A second line of evidence for an intrinsic circaseptan component stems from the demonstration of statistically significant differences in timing of a circaseptan rhythm in springtail oviposition. A third line of evidence documents prominent circaseptan rhythmicity after the application of a single stimulus (devoid in itself of any circaseptan information). Such single stimulus induction, amplification and/or synchronization also documents the clinical and biologic importance of built-in circaseptan rhythms that were previously often misinterpreted as being purely reactive: a circaseptan spectral component is remarkably prominent in mammalian organ transplant rejection, both in the clinic and in the laboratory. In the latter case, in the absence of any weekly cycles in hospital routine, including treatment schedules, circaseptan components characterize the rejection of the rat kidney, pancreas and heart. Much additional information here reviewed reveals the occurrence of periods of about 7 days. Their implications for transplant and other chronoimmunology as well as biology in general, and their clinical applications in drug treatment, include the need to weld circaseptan timing to circadian timing and dosing. A dramatic documentation of this need stems from the circumstance that pretreatment for one week with the same total dose of the same substance (a polysaccharide - Lentinan) accelerates or retards cancerous growth (hence shortens or lengthens survival) as a function of interactive circaseptan and circadian rhythms.</td>

The existence of a peculiar chronobiological pattern in the onset of acute cerebrovascular disease, characterized by both circadian (morning and evening occurrence), circaseptan (last and first days of the week), and circannual (especially in winter) is confirmed, although differences depending on biological (gender, age), pathological (diabetes, hypertension, smoke, alcohol), cultural, social, and environmental factors exist.

      <td>Longitudinal records of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) around the clock for days, weeks, months, years, and even decades obtained by manual self-measurements (during waking) and/or automatically by ambulatory monitoring reveal, in addition to well-known large within-day variation, also considerable day-to-day variability in most people, whether normotensive or hypertensive. As a first step, the circadian rhythm is considered along with gender differences and changes as a function of age to derive time-specified reference values (chronodesms), while reference values accumulate to also account for the circaseptan variation. Chronodesms serve for the interpretation of single measurements and of circadian and other rhythm parameters. Refined diagnoses can thus be obtained, namely MESOR-hypertension when the chronome-adjusted mean value (MESOR) of BP is above the upper limit of acceptability, excessive pulse pressure (EPP) when the difference in MESOR between the systolic (S) and diastolic (D) BP is too large, CHAT (circadian hyper-amplitude tension) when the circadian BP amplitude is excessive, DHRV (decreased heart rate variability) when the standard deviation (SD) of HR is below the acceptable range, and/or ecphasia when the overall high values recurring each day occur at an odd time (a condition also contributing to the risk associated with 'non-dipping'). A non-parametric approach consisting of a computer comparison of the subject's profile with the time-varying limits of acceptability further serves as a guide to optimize the efficacy of any needed treatment by timing its administration (chronotherapy) and selecting a treatment schedule best suited to normalize abnormal patterns in BP and/or HR. The merit of the proposed chronobiological approach to BP screening, diagnosis and therapy (chronotheranostics) is assessed in the light of outcome studies. Elevated risk associated with abnormal patterns of BP and/or HR variability, even when most if not all measurements lie within the range of acceptable values, becomes amenable to treatment as a critical step toward prevention (prehabilitation) to reduce the need for rehabilitation (the latter often after costly surgical intervention).</td>

Based on the headaches scales, there were significant differences in headache severity among the 28 days of the standard 21/7 cycles (P &lt; .001). Greater headache severity occurred on days 25 through 28 during the 7-day placebo interval of the 21/7 cycles (P &lt; .05). Of the 111 patients who completed the 21/7 phase of the study, 102 (92%) completed the 168-day extended placebo-free OC regimen. During the first 28 days of the extended placebo-free regimen, daily headache scores decreased (P &lt; .0001) compared to those of the previous 21 active/7 placebo day cycle. The difference on a daily basis was first detected on extended cycle days 25 through 28 (P &lt; .0001) and persisted throughout the remainder of the 168-day regimen. Subjects were divided into 2 groups (severe and mild) based on the median of the total headache score during the 21/7 OC cycle. The group with higher total headache scores demonstrated a significant (P &lt; .0001) reduction in daily headaches beginning in the first 28-day interval of the extended placebo-free regimen, persisting throughout the entire 168-day extended regimen. In contrast, the group with the lower total headache score remained unchanged (P = .79) throughout the extended regimen. Impact of headaches on work, family, and social functions also improved on the extended placebo-free regimen in 6 of 8 measures (P &lt; .05) assessed by weekly headache questionnaires.Conclusion.-Compared to a 21/7-day OC regimen, a 168-day extended placebo-free regimen of DRSP/EE led to a decrease in headache severity along with improvement in work productivity and involvement in activities. This is a preliminary study and results may not be widely generalizable.</td>

We are able to select a desired threshold of gravity(g)-forces between 0.01g and 0.50g and to simultaneously monitor 3 kinds of activity along with an averaged g-force every minute. As a routine study, we monitored at settings of 0.01g, 0.05g and 0.20g and averaged on one channel. Part of the time, physical activity was monitored together with ambulatorily monitored blood pressure (BP) and the ECG, or at least heart rate (HR). Physical activity showed a circasemiseptan and circaseptan periodicity as well as the circadian component, especially in subjects with an irregular sleep-wakefulness life style. On the average, physical activity was greater on a working day than on a holiday. Everyday physical activity reflects in part the ability to exercise, and it is expected that this actometer can contribute or provide an objective individualized quality-of-life index. The effect of physical activity on circadian profiles of BP, HR and HR variability is also examined. We observed that BP started to increase several hours before getting up. This fact likely shows that there is an endogenous circadian rhythm in BP, independently of the sleep-wakefulness cycle. Lastly, we investigated the relationship between physical activity and HR in patients permanently paced; we confirmed that the DDDR pacing mode was more physiological than the VVI or VVIR mode. This newly developed actometer will bring about further progress in chronobiology.</td>

The data were analyzed by linear-nonlinear rhythmometry. Results. As anticipated, in LD12:12, a prominent circadian rhythm was observed, with a marked 12-hour component qualifying the circadian waveform. By comparison, in LD10:10 and in LD14:14, the circadian rhythm had a reduced amplitude and a period close to that of the environmental synchronizer. Extra-circadian variation was then also demonstrated. In conclusion, circadian lighting schedules affect a broader-than-circadian time structure of locomotor activity in mice.</td>

      <td>In continuous darkness for about 5.5 days in eleven replications, the pineal shows neither only a decreasing trend nor only a damped circadian rhythm; there is an infradian modulation: after an initial decline, melatonin production increases again, with a pattern compatible with the assumption, for at least one cycle, that a built-in pineal week has a larger extent of predictable change than that of a pineal day. Melatonin release from the isolated pike pineal reveals a circadian rhythm which, on the average, is damped, but demonstrable in the second half of a time series covering 5.5 days (P &lt; 0.05). At fixed environmental temperatures of 10, 15, 19 or 20 degrees C (the latter two pooled), single and population mean cosinor analyses reject the assumptions of zero circaseptan and circadian amplitudes in the chronome of the pineal from the pike (Esox lucius L.). The circaseptan pattern is confounded by possible trends. The time series analyzed are brief, yet validate, by a one-way analysis of variance in plexograms as well as by cosinor, an about-weekly pattern, if not (yet) rhythm, on the basis of 745 determinations. The circaseptan- and circasemiseptan-to-circadian amplitude ratios are numerically larger than unity, on the average (2.014; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.120 to 3.641 and 1.107; CI: 0.724 to 1.693, respectively). A positive correlation of the urinary excretion rate of a major breakdown product of melatonin of a cancer patient with a circulating cancer marker serving as a gauge of disease progression lends an oncologic perspective to the amplitude ratios of melatonin release in vitro here reported.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</td>

Five inbred male DBA mice, about 18 weeks of age, were implanted with transsensors for temperature telemetry. Core temperature, monitored every 10 min for 3 days before the intravenous or intraperitoneal inoculation of 10(5) infected erythrocytes and thereafter until death, was analyzed by cosinor. A statistically highly significant circadian rhythm exhibited similarly synchronized acrophases. Core temperatures on the days immediately after malarial infection were mostly within the range of temperatures observed before injection. A mesor-hypothermic stage preceded death by several days. In a second study, 24 male BALB/c and 42 male DBA mice, 12 weeks of age, housed in three rooms on different regimens of light and darkness (alternating at 12-hr intervals), staggered by 8 hr, were inoculated ip with 10(4) infected erythrocytes, one-half at noon, the other half at midnight, within 0.5 hr of blood withdrawal. Thus, one endeavored to cover six circadian host stages (02, 06, 10, 14, 18, and 22 hr after light-on). At 54 and 51% overall mortality (irrespective of inoculation time), a circadian rhythm in susceptibility to malaria was demonstrated in these mice by the single cosinor fit of a 24-hr period (P less than 0.003 and less than 0.020, respectively). The single cosinor fit of a 7-day period further demonstrated a circaseptan rhythm (P = 0.014) in the mortality of both strains following the inoculation of P. berghei. The acrophase (360 degrees = 168 hr) was at -325 degrees from the inoculation time with 95% confidence limits extending from -276 to -378 degrees. Such predictable time relations of P. berghei to its murine host await the exploration of mechanisms underlying the circadian and infradian (7-day) rhythmicities here demonstrated and quantified with their uncertainties. Irrespective of mechanisms, information on such periodicities may also guide attempts to optimize treatment by timing according to the interactions of plasmodial virulence and host resistance that remain to be quantified separately.</td>

Evidence was also found for a circaseptan rhythm as well as an about 3-day rhythm in the response to the photoperiodic shifts. These results are consistent with those reported by F.

      <td>System times and time horizons for biospheric near-matches of primarily non-photic environmental cycles.</td>
      <td>System time is defined as the duration (T) and sampling density (deltat) of a given study. A time horizon is obtained by combining analytical results on endpoints of time structures (chronomes), usually on control groups, from accumulating diverse studies carried out with drastically different values of T and deltat. These two design considerations depend upon and are limited by resources. The desideratum of a small At e.g., for studies of chaotic endpoints, limits T, e.g., has thus far precluded a continuous mapping of decadal cycles in endpoints such as the approximate entropy or the correlation dimension. Time horizons are being documented for an increasing number of variables that undergo cycles with infra-annual frequencies - with one cycle in about one, two and/or five decades - in the biosphere as in the environment. These infra-annuals, in and around us, modulate ultra-annuals, including circadians, as well as about 7-day (circaseptan) and about half-yearly (circasemiannual) cycles, all prominent, e.g., in geophysical and biospheric specta. Neglect of infra-annual chronomics can lead to blunders. A statistically highly significant decrease in the excretion of steroidal metabolites (or in heart rate variability) may be misinterpreted as premature aging if it lasts for several years, and may be unnecessarily acted upon, e.g., by drugs. The decrease, however, may only be transient, occurring only during a given stage of a circadecadal cycle, and it may be followed for the next several years by an also spurious rejuvenation, possibly misinterpreted as a drug effect. When recognized as the alternating stages of decadal cycles and assessed with an affordable deltat, infra-annuals of variables involved in major problems of our day, including homicides and wars, may lead us to manipulable internal or external mechanisms, and thus, eventually, possibly to countermeasures to crime and terror as well as to the optimization of aims such as spirituality.</td>

      <td>To assess circadian and circaseptan rhythmic intermodulation, female mice, kept on regimens of 12 hr light (L) alternating with 12 hr of darkness (D) (LD 12:12) were sampled for 1-13 days at six circadian stages. Pineals were removed and homogenized with 0.9% NaCl. Adenohypophyses were bisected and incubated in Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRb) and/or with 10(-7) M melatonin (Mt). Adrenals were bisected and incubated with KRb, with 10(-7) M Mt, with 0.05 IU of ACTH 1-17 (Sy; Hoechst, Italy), or with Sy + 0.025 ml of the aqueous pineal homogenate (APH). ACTH and prolactin (PRL) in adenohypophysis incubation fluid were determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA), and corticosterone in adrenal incubation fluid was determined by RIA or by a fluorometric method. By this chronobiologic approach, time series were collected systematically in the search for predictable variability. Once these series reveal an algorithmically formulatable pattern, with a waveform validated by inferential statistical means, they are graded in terms of complexity as alpha, beta, gamma, and delta rhythms. Spontaneously (alpha-) rhythmic along the 24-h scale is the corticosterone produced by bisected adrenal glands incubated with KRb only, and the Mt content of the APH, in keeping with earlier work. Reactively (beta-) rhythmic is the response, again along the 24-hr scale, of the adrenal to Sy or Mt and the response of the anterior pituitary to Mt at different circadian times. Modulatory (gamma and delta) rhythms characterize the Mt effect on the (beta-rhythmic) adrenal stimulation by Sy. Chronomodulations thus emerge as more or less complete sequences of a decrease, no effect and/or increase; or, rather, as an attenuation, no effect and/or amplification by the pineal, of the pituitary effect upon the adrenal. Linear least-squares rhythmometry, mostly single cosinors, describes and quantifies circadian (alpha, beta, and gamma) and infradian (delta) rhythms in the original series and in the differences in responses [beta - alpha] and [gamma - beta] (P less than 0.001 in each case). These spontaneous alpha, response beta, modulatory gamma, and frequency-divided delta rhythms reveal a collateral neuroendocrine hierarchy, characterized by the pineal feedsideward phenomenon, as a feature of interactions recurring with circadian and infradian frequencies.</td>

According to available evidence, variability of working hours seems to play an important role. The question, however, is how this variability can be assessed and used to explain or predict impairments. Based on earlier methods used to assess shift-work effects, a time series analysis approach was applied to the matter of flexible working hours. Data on the working hours of 4 week's length of 137 respondents derived from a survey on flexible work hours involving 15 companies of different production and service sectors in Germany were converted to time series and analyzed by spectral analysis. A cluster analysis of the resulting power spectra yielded 5 clusters of flexible work hours. Analyzing these clusters for differences in reported impairments showed that workers who showed suppression of circadian and weekly rhythms experienced severest impairments, especially in circadian controlled functions like sleep and digestion. The results thus indicate that analyzing the periodicity of flexible working hours seems to be a promising approach for predicting impairments which should be investigated further in the future.</td>

      <td>In the colonial growth of botryllid ascidians, blastogenesis (bud formation) is a cyclical and synchronized developmental process characterized by a weekly rhythm of budding and apoptotic events. Very little is known about this cycle regulation and its control. In this study, the in vitro fate of developing buds and regressing zooids extirpated from Botryllus schlosseri colonies at different blastogenic stages were examined, revealing that stages 'B' to 'D' buds (but not stage 'A' buds) developed new structures under in vitro conditions. These were mainly spheres (up to 1 mm in diameter) and epithelial monolayers around the attached buds. We also found that: (1) when attached spheres and epithelial monolayers appeared, the life expectancy of an isolated bud in vitro reached 50-60 days, five times the life expectancy of intact, in vivo developing zooids; (2) the life expectancy of in vitro buds that remained unattached to the substrates was at least 150 days; (3) after attaching to the substrates, buds obeyed a newly imposed developmental clock dictating up to 35 survival days for spheres and up to 14 days for epithelial monolayers; (4) the prevailing mode of death in vitro was necrotic, in contrast to the apoptotic mode of zooidal deterioration at the takeover phase of blastogenesis; (5) under in vitro conditions, degenerating zooids surprisingly produced epithelial monolayers within 3 weeks of culturing. Monolayers survived for up to 10 additional days, extending the lifespan of the degenerating zooids from a few hours to up to 1 month. We conclude that under in vitro conditions, not only are the underlying colonial growth mechanisms replaced by different developmental pathways, but also the internal colonial-level clocks programming death, are replaced by a new biological mechanism with different timetables.</td>

      <td>Investor sentiment is an important factor that affects stock prices, stock market returns, and asset pricing. However, the fluctuation patterns and factors influencing investor sentiment have received less attention from scholars. This study uses text messages from stock investors' social networks and natural language processing techniques to reveal sentiment fluctuation laws of stock market investors. An investor confidence index (ICI) is constructed by quantifying sentiment in investor messages on social networks. By taking this index as a proxy for sentiment, we measure the candidate fluctuation periods of investor sentiment using a Fourier transform. The significance test then determines the significant cycle of investor sentiment within seven days. Based on this, cluster analysis further reveals that investor sentiment in the 7-day cycle has a 5 + 2 cycle of variability. That is, from Monday to Friday, investor sentiment is disturbed by stock market sentiment showing profit-seeking and risk-averse preferences, while during the weekend holiday, stock market disturbance to investor sentiment becomes lower, investor sentiment is substantially higher, and volatility is narrowed, showing a typical holiday effect. The analysis also shows that the recurring cycle of 5-day trading days and 2-day holidays is a direct exogenous factor contributing to the 7-day cycle of investor sentiment. This study provides a new perspective for studying investor sentiment, day of the week effect, and behavioral finance.</td>

      <td>BackgroundMany acute cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction (MI) follow circadian rhythms. Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) is a newly noticed entity with limited data on onset pattern and its impact on prognosis.Material and methodsIn this observational study of Swedish MINOCA patients registered in the SWEDEHEART registry between 2003-2013 and followed until December 2013 we identified 9,092 unique patients with MINOCA out of 199,163 MI admissions in total. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated for whole hours, parts of the day, weekdays, months, seasons and major holidays.ResultsThe mean age was 65.5 years, 62.0% were women and 16.6% presented with STEMI. The risk for MINOCA proved to be most common in the morning (IRR = 1.70, 95% CI [1.63-1.84]) with a peak at 08.00 AM (IRR = 2.25, 95% CI [1.96-2.59]) and on Mondays (IRR = 1.28, 95% CI [1.18-1.38]). No altered risk was detected during the different seasons, the Christmas and New Year holidays or the Swedish Midsummer festivities. There was no association between time of onset of MINOCA and short-or long-term prognosis.ConclusionThe onset of MINOCA shows a circadian and circaseptan variation with increased risk at early mornings and Mondays, similar to previous studies on all MI, suggesting stress related triggering. However, during holidays were traditional MI increase, we did not see any increase for MINOCA. No association was detected between time of onset and prognosis, indicating that the underlying pathological mechanisms of MINOCA and the quality of care are similar at different times of onset but triggering mechanism may be more active early mornings and Mondays.</td>

Rhythms of several frequencies were found, including prominent 24-hour rhythms with acrophases around 13:00 (light intensity) and 16:00 (noise). For light and noise, the ratio formed by dividing the amplitude of a 1-week (circaseptan) or half-week (circasemiseptan) fitted cosine curve by the amplitude of a 24-hour fitted cosine curve is smaller than unity, since 24-hour rhythms are prominent for these variables. The amplitude ratios are larger than unity for temperature in the newborns' unit but not in the infants' unit. Earlier, the origin of the about-7-day rhythms of neonatal physiologic variables was demonstrated to have, in addition to a major endogenous, also a minor exogenous component. Hence, the possibility of optimizing maturation by manipulating environmental changes can be considered, using, as gauges of development, previously mapped chronomes (time structures of biologic multifrequency rhythms, trends and noise).</td>

      <td>This study investigates typical domestic energy demand profiles and their variation over time. It draws on a sample of 13,000 homes from Great Britain, applying k -means cluster analysis to smart meter data on their electricity and gas demand over a three-year period from September 2019 to August 2022. Eight typical demand archetypes are identified from the data, varying in terms of the shape of their demand profile over the course of the day. These include an 'All daytime' archetype, where demand rises in the morning and remains high until the evening. Several other archetypes vary in terms of the presence and timing of morning and/or evening peaks. In the case of electricity demand, a 'Midday trough' archetype is notable for its negative midday demand and high overnight demand, likely a combination of the effects of rooftop solar panels exporting to the grid during the day and overnight charging of electric vehicles or electric storage heating. The prevalence of each archetype across the sample varies substantially in relation to different temporally -varying factors. Fluctuations in their prevalence on weekends can be identified, as can Christmas Day. Among homes with gas central heating, the prevalence of gas archetypes strongly relates to external temperature, with around half of homes fitting the 'All daytime' archetype at temperatures below 0 degrees C, and few fitting it above 14 degrees C. COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on work and schooling are associated with households' patterns of daily demand becoming more similar on weekdays and weekends, particularly for households with children and/or workers. The latter group had still not returned to pre -pandemic patterns by March 2022. The results indicate that patterns of daily energy demand vary with factors ranging from societal weekly rhythms and festivals to seasonal temperature changes and system shocks like pandemics, with implications for demand forecasting and policymaking.</td>

Some of these rhythms show large enough amplitudes to be clinically important, especially if consecutive samples of the same patients are to be evaluated. Rhythm disturbances characterize hematologic and immune related disease states like, e.g., infection with HIV. Circadian rhythms in the aggregability and adhesiveness of blood platelets contribute to the transient state of hypercoagulability during the morning hours which is thought to lead to the peak incidence at this time of myocardial infarction, cerebral infarct, and sudden cardiac death. The rhythmic, and thus in their timing to a certain degree, predictable changes in responsiveness of the hematopoietic and immune system provide an opportunity to improve the effects of growth factors and cytokines, and decrease their undesirable side effects. Timing of cancer chemotherapy at the time of maximal resistance of the hematopoietic system to a certain drug may improve the often dose limiting toxicity of the agent. Some preliminary results suggest that not only treatment toxicity may be diminished, but also efficacy may be improved. This approach is made difficult by the large individual differences in the timing of the rhythms, and by the interaction of circadian, circaseptan, and circannual rhythms which have, thus far, been only incompletely explored.</td>

In 224 people (88 men and 136 women; mean age: 56.8 +/- 11.2 years) of U town, Hokkaido (latitude: 43.45 degrees N, longitude: 141.85 degrees E), a chronoecological health watch was started in April 2001. Consultations were repeated every 3 months. Results at the November 30, 2004 follow-up are presented herein. 7-day/24-h blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) monitoring started on a Thursday, with readings taken at 30-min intervals between 07:00 h and 22:00 h and at 60-min intervals between 22:00 h and 07:00 h. Data stored in the memory of the monitor (TM-2430-15, A and D company, Japan) were retrieved and analyzed on a personal computer with a commercial software for this device. Subjects were asked to answer a self-administered questionnaire inquiring about 15 items of a depression scale, at the start of study and again after 1-2 years. Subjects with a score higher by at least two points at the second versus first screening were classified as having a depressive mood. The other subjects served as the control group. The mean follow-up time was 1064 days, during which four subjects suffered an adverse vascular outcome (myocardial infarction: one man and one woman; stroke: two men). Among the variables used in the Cox proportional hazard models, a depressive mood, assessed by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), as well as the MESOR of diastolic (D) BP (DBP-MESOR) and the circadian amplitude of systolic (S) BP (SBP-Amplitude) showed a statistically significant association with the occurrence of adverse vascular outcomes. The GDS score during the second but not during the first session was statistically significantly associated with the adverse vascular outcome. In univariate analyses, the relative risk (RR) of developing outcomes was predicted by a three-point increase in the GDS scale (RR = 3.088, 95% CI: 1.375-6.935, P = 0.0063). Increases of 5 mmHg in DBP-MESOR and of 3 mmHg in SBP-Amplitude were associated with RRs of 2.143 (95% CI: 1.232-3.727, P = 0.0070) and 0.700 (95% CI: 0.495-0.989, P = 0.0430), respectively. In multivariate analyses, when both the second GDS score and the DBP-MESOR were used as continuous variables in the same model, GDS remained statistically significantly associated with the occurrence of cardiovascular death. After adjustment for DBP-MESOR, a three-point increase in GDS score was associated with a RR of 2.172 (95% CI: 1.123-4.200). Monday endpoints of the 7-day profile showed a statistically significant association with adverse vascular outcomes. A 5 mmHg increase in DBP on Monday was associated with a RR of 1.576 (95% CI: 1.011-2.457, P = 0.0446). The main result of the present study is that in middle-aged community-dwelling people, a depressive mood predicted the occurrence of vascular diseases beyond the prediction provided by age, gender, ABP, lifestyle and environmental conditions, as assessed by means of a multivariate Cox model. A depressive mood, especially enhanced for 1-2 years, was associated with adverse vascular outcomes. Results herein suggest the clinical importance of repetitive assessments of a depressive mood and the need to take sufficient care of depressed subjects. Another result herein is that circadian and circaseptan characteristics of BP variability measured 7-day/24-h predicted the occurrence of vascular disease beyond the prediction provided by age, gender, depressive mood and lifestyle, as assessed by means of a multivariate Cox model. Earlier, we showed that the morning surge in BP on Mondays was statistically significantly higher compared with other weekdays. Although a direct association between the Monday surge in BP and cardiovascular events could not be demonstrated herein, it is possible that the BP surge on Monday mornings may also trigger cardiovascular events. We have shown that depressive people exhibit a more prominent circaseptan variation in SBP, DBP and the double product (DP) compared to non-depressed subjects. In view of the strong relation between depression and adverse cardiac events, studies should be done to ascertain that depression is properly diagnosed and treated. Chronodiagnosis and chronotherapy can reduce an elevated blood pressure and improve the altered variability in BP and HR, thus reducing the incidence of adverse cardiac events. This recommendation stands at the basis of chronomics, focusing on prehabilitation in preference to rehabilitation, as a public service offered in several Japanese towns.</td>

But to this point, such findings could be instrument-dependent as they rely exclusively on coding using the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count. Further, research has shown that self-referential content has higher relevance and meaning for individuals, compared with other types of content. Investigating the specificity of self-referential material in temporal patterns of emotional expression in tweets is of interest, but current research is based upon generic textual productions. The temporal variations of emotions shared in tweets through emojis have not been compared to textual analyses to date. This study hence focuses on several comparisons: (i) between Self-referencing tweets versus Other topic tweets, (ii) between coding of textual productions versus coding of emojis, and finally (iii) between coding of textual productions using different sentiment analysis tools (the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count-LIWC; the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner-VADER and the Hu Liu sentiment lexicon-Hu Liu). In a collection of more than 7 million Self-referencing and close to 18 million Other topic content-coded tweets, we identified that (i) similarities and differences in terms of shape and amplitude can be observed in temporal trajectories of expressed emotions between Self-referring and Other topic tweets, (ii) that all tools feature significant circadian and circaseptan patterns in both datasets but not always, and there is often a correspondence in the shape of circadian and circaseptan patterns, and finally (iii) that circadian and circaseptan patterns obtained from the coding of emotional expression in emojis sometimes depart from those of the textual analysis, indicating some complementarity in the use of both modes of expression. We discuss the implications of our findings from the perspective of the literature on emotions and well-being.</td>

The mean value of the R-R intervals (R-R), their standard deviation (SDNN) and other HRV endpoints, computed over consecutive 5-min intervals, served as markers of the subject's functional associations with the amplitude of fluctuations in atmospheric pressure (FAP) and the planetary Kp index of geomagnetic disturbance. About-weekly and half-weekly cycles in HRV endpoints indicate a reduction in physiological 'preparedness', here described as 'dynamics', of the subject investigated on Saturdays and Sundays and a sharp increase in 'dynamics' on Mondays. The waveform of the weekly oscillation seemed to be influenced by ambient air temperature and FAP. On Mondays, an FAP amplification or a temperature rise was accompanied by a significant decrease in R-R and SDNN, indicating an aggravation of a 'Monday effect' in physiological 'dynamics'. HRV endpoints also revealed about-5-day and about-12-day cyclic components similar to those found in FAP. The infradian pattern in a 70-day record differed from one found earlier in a 50-day record of the same subject. Changes in the natural physical environment (past as well as present), especially in air temperature and FAP, likely influence(d) if not synchronize(d) the amplitude and waveform of infradian weekly and half-weekly physiological cycles. Some of these infradians, their wobbly nature notwithstanding, may have been built into our temporal make-up by an evolutionary integration of life in the non-stationary quasi-periodic natural physical environment, which continues to contribute to variability.</td>

Primary end point was a composite nonadherence score measuring patient-registered ticagrelor adherence, defined as a combination of adherence failure events (2 missed doses registered in 7-day cycles) and treatment gaps (4 consecutive missed doses). Secondary end points included change in cardiovascular risk factors, quality of life (European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions), and patient device satisfaction (System Usability Scale).Results Patient mean age was 58 years, 81% were men, and 21% were current smokers. At 6 months, greater patient registered drug adherence was achieved in the active vs the control group (nonadherence score: 16.6 vs 22.8 [P = .025]). Numerically, the active group was associated with higher degree of smoking cessation, increased physical activity, and change in quality of life; however, this did not reach statistical significance. Patient satisfaction was significantly higher in the active vs the control group (system usability score: 87.3 vs 78.1 [P = .001]).Conclusions In MI patients, use of an interactive patient support tool improved patient self-reported drug adherence and may be associated with a trend toward improved cardiovascular lifestyle changes and quality of life. Use of a disease-specific interactive patient support tool may be an appreciated, simple, and promising complement to standard secondary prevention.</td>

Evidence for non-photic solar effects on biota is also slowly being recognized. The ultrastructure of cardiomyocytes from rabbits, the time structure of blood pressure and heart rate of neonates, and the heart rate variability of human adults on earth and in space were examined during magnetically disturbed and quiet days, as were morbidity statistics. Alterations in both the about-daily (circadian) and about-weekly (circaseptan) components are observed during disturbed vs. quite days. The about-weekly period of neonatal blood pressure correlates with that of the local geomagnetic disturbance index K. Circaseptans which are seen early in human life and in various other forms of life, including unicells, may provide information about the possible site(s) of life's origins from an integrative as well as adaptive evolutionary perspective.</td>

Our results show the existence of circadian rhythms in heart rate, in the duration of the QT interval and also in the voltage of R and T waves. Our data for R and T wave voltages do not completely agree with those from other authors. We demonstrated also that smoking may influence the circadian acrophase of the rhythm in R wave voltage while sleeping does not show any relationship with R and T wave voltages although it seems related to the displacement of the ST segment. We could point out only small differences in the chronobiologic behavior of patients with coronary disease and that of normal subjects, unlike the results previously reported by other authors. Our study demonstrated the existence of circadian and ultradian rhythms in premature atrial and ventricular beats as well as circadian and circaseptan rhythms in arterial blood pressure. Further studies are needed to improve our chronobiologic knowledge in order to optimize dosage and time of administration of the drugs used in the long term management of arrhythmias and hypertension.</td>

      <td>Evidence for the ubiquity and partial endogenicity of about-weekly (circaseptan) components and multiples and/or submultiples thereof (the multiseptans) accumulates as longer and denser records become available. Often attributed to a mere response to the social schedule, circaseptan components now have been documented to characterize environmental variables related to primarily non-photic solar effects. Plausibly, like circadians, circaseptans are anchored in genomes, from bacteria to humans, via both an internal and external evolution. If so, circaseptans, like circadians, may be found in the absence of a 7-day schedule, whereas the social schedule may play a synchronizing role and be responsible for the detection of prominent weekly variations in population statistics. The wobbliness of multiseptans and other components of some environmental time structures (chronomes) may correspond to the wobbliness of multiseptans found in cardiovascular morbidity statistics. Here, the latter stem primarily, but not exclusively, from an extensive database on the incidence of daily calls for an ambulance in Moscow, Russia from 1979-1981. A modulation of multiseptans and other chronome components of both environmental and biological variables by the about 11-year solar activity cycle (and of other low-frequency signals reviewed elsewhere) may account for prior controversies and scepticism about a variety of non-photic effects on biota. This is notably the case when relatively short series are analyzed without consideration of effects of unassessed long-term variations; this is the task of the new field of chronomics. In the spectral element of the chronomes of geophysical and biospherical variability, there are natural near weeks,apart from any precise 7-day periodicity.</td>

The study subjects were young married couples, with a median age of 25, living in North Carolina. All avoided conception by means other than oral contraception (OC). The husband and wife were paid $1.00/day for completing a questionnaire each morning, reporting whether they had engaged in intercourse in the previous 24 hours. Subjects recorded copulatory events to the nearest hour. Discrepancies between report pairs on whether intercourse had occurred were less than 1%. The data presented are from 2 studies, 1 consisting of 48 couples, reporting 1230 copulations between September 3 and December 2, 1973, and the other of 30 couples, over 711 copulations recorded between June 8 and September 5, 1974. Only the women's responses are reported here; menses were ignored. The average copulation rate/couple was 2.48 times/week in the 1973 study and 2.34 times/week for the 1974 group. The extreme values were 7.4 times/week and 0.64 times/week. Combining all the data produced a mean rate of 2.44 copulations/week. Mean daily copulatory rates for both studies were so similar that the data were pooled into a single curve for presentation. The copulation rates on weekdays were very similar, with just under 1/3 of the sample copulating each day. The average daily rates increased to 40.3% on Saturdays and to 52.6% on Sundays. The rate on Friday differed significantly from Saturday and Saturday from Sunday. 38.3% of the week's copulations occurred on the weekend. On 10.6% of the days that couples copulated, they did so twice or (rarely) 3 times, in a single day. Single-couple multiple copulations were 3.4 times more common on Sundays than on a weekday and 1.6 times more common than on Saturdays. 61% in 1973 and 66% in 1974 of all weekday copulations took place between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m. For the weekend it was mainly the augmented copulation rates during the mornings and afternoons that caused the weekend copulatory rate to be significantly higher. In the 1974 study, the women recorded whether they had experienced orgasm during intercourse. As a group, they failed to reach orgasm in 29.4% of their encounters. Between the hours of midnight and 11:00 a.m., 38.6% of all copulation failed to result in orgasm for the women, but between noon and midnight, the rate improved significantly.</td>

      <td>For designing and evaluating the impacts of emerging mobility services, we need activity-based demand systems considering multi-week activity patterns and their variations. This study explored the inter- and infra-individual variations of time use in leisure activities during a non-working day. Specifically, the workday time-use impact on non-working-day time-use and their variations across two Japanese cities were examined in a metropolitan city (Yokohama) and a provincial city (Matsuyama). We used panel multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) models with five-week GPS-based data in the two cities. The results demonstrated the significant relationships between workday time-use and non-working day time-use (i.e., salient weekly rhythms) in Yokohama, but not in Matsuyama. For example, in Yokohama, (1) participants with long-time shopping on workday spent more time on recreation and less time on shopping on non-working day and (2) long-time workers on workday spent more time shopping on non-working days. Moreover, we clarified that workday timeuse explained large portions of inter-individual variations in Yokohama while intra-individual variations were dominant in Matsuyama. It indicates that inhabitants in Yokohama were more affected by the time-use on workdays. In addition, activity time-use patterns in Matsuyama were more random than Yokohama since inhabitants in Matsuyama could take more flexible activity time-use patterns. Understanding such heterogeneous activity patterns will be crucial in developing and evaluating new mobility services in the future.</td>

      <td>Forecasting heat demand is necessary for production and operation planning of district heating (DH) systems. In this study we first propose a simple regression model where the hourly outdoor temperature and wind speed forecast the heat demand. Weekly rhythm of heat consumption as a social component is added to the model to significantly improve the accuracy. The other type of model is the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model with exogenous variables as a combination to take weather factors, and the historical heat consumption data as depending variables. One outstanding advantage of the model is that it peruses the high accuracy for both long-term and short-term forecast by considering both exogenous factors and time series. The forecasting performance of both linear regression models and time series model are evaluated based on real-life heat demand data for the city of Espoo in Finland by out-of-sample tests for the last 20 full weeks of the year. The results indicate that the proposed linear regression model (T168h) using 168-h demand pattern with midweek holidays classified as Saturdays or Sundays gives the highest accuracy and strong robustness among all the tested models based on the tested forecasting horizon and corresponding data. Considering the parsimony of the input, the ease of use and the high accuracy, the proposed T168h model is the best in practice. The heat demand forecasting model can also be developed for individual buildings if automated meter reading customer measurements are available. This would allow forecasting the heat demand based on more accurate heat consumption data directly from the customers and almost in real time. Also, the model can be used for production planning of combined heat and power (CHP) system to improve the energy efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

      <td>Depression, which is a risk factor for cardiac morbidity and mortality, is not an unusual occurrence among individuals with coronary heart disease (CHD), but evidence concerning its role in the pathogenesis of this condition is less clear. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has become an important tool in the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Several previous studies have indicated that various kinds of target organ damage and cardiovascular morbidity are more strongly associated with a diagnosis by ABPM than through spot-checks in a clinical setting. This study investigated whether depressive mood was associated with changes in the about-weekly (circaseptan) and half-weekly (circasemiseptan) variations in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR), including a BP surge on Mondays, in community-dwelling subjects monitored chronomically for the time structure (chronome) of their BP and HR variabilities. From April 2001 to April 2003, 217 subjects (85 men and 132 women; mean age: 56.8 +/- 11.3 yr) from U town, Hokkaido (latitude: 43.45 degrees N, longitude: 141.85 degrees E), self-monitored their BP and HR for 7 days starting around 11 a.m. on Thursday, and took readings at 30-minute intervals between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m., then at 60-minute intervals between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. The data were retrieved and analyzed on a PC with appropriate commercial software (TM-2430-15; A&amp;D Co., Japan). Subjects were asked about 15 items on a depression rating scale through a self-administered questionnaire. When the score amounted to 5 or higher, subjects were considered to be depressive. Student's t-test, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and cosinor methods with parametric tests were also used. A p-value below 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance (below 0.10: borderline statistical significance). Depression rating scales were obtained for 192 out of the 217 subjects enrolled in this study. Depression scores were (&gt;) 5 in 72 subjects. The average values of systolic (S) and diastolic (D) BP were statistically significantly higher in depressed subjects (SBP: 129.2 vs 124.5 mmHg; p = 0.034; DBP: 79.0 vs 76.5 mmHg; p = 0.041). The 7-day average for HR did not differ between subjects with depression scores of &lt; 5 or &gt; 5. DBP dipping was less in the depressed subjects (16.30 vs 18.22%; p = 0.048). The dipping ratios of SBP and HR showed no statistically significant difference. In the group with depression scores of &lt; 5, HR variability (estimated by the SD of HR and HR dip) was higher during vacations and lower on Mondays. The 24-h BP measures showed a novelty effect and a surge on Mondays. In the depressed group, a prominent circaseptan rhythm appeared to replace the novelty effect, vacation dip, and Monday surge. The results of this investigation indicate the clinical importance of the monitoring of depressed subjects. Fewer than 7 days of monitoring means a greater risk of false diagnosis, and thus a therapeutic decision including potentially unnecessary or inappropriate long-term treatment. Records shorter than 7 days would not have detected circaseptan BP dysrhythmia associated with a depressive state. Prominent circaseptans can provide new indications on the mechanisms underlying the strong relation between depression and adverse cardiac events. Future studies should aim at determining whether the treatment of depression, especially from the standpoint of a chronodiagnosis and chronotherapy, can reduce the incidence of adverse cardiac events, and whether this depends upon restoring normal BP and HR variability, i.e. anormal BP and HR chronome.</td>

The first group (1-3 years: n = 6) consisted of girls living in a children's home, the second (26-50 years, n = 7) of medical staff and the third (65-87 years, n = 7) of the inhabitants of an old-age home. Subsequent to basic statistics the excretion patterns were analyzed by spectral analysis with the maximum entropy method. The mean values of all enzymes displayed a distinct age-dependency. The highest levels of enzyme excretion were found in the early childhood. In all groups infradian changes of enzyme excretion were detected. In excretion of gamma-glutamyltransferase, longer periods between 12 and 24 days predominated during the early childhood, whereas in the middle, and in particular in the higher age, shorter dominant periods occurred more frequently. The excretion of alanine aminopeptidase displayed a similar tendency. Circaseptan periods (7 +/- 1 days) were rarely observed among the dominant periods of the maximum entropy method spectra. A correlation analysis of the individual excretion patterns revealed that the excretion of all three bush-border enzymes is most tightly correlated in the early childhood (coefficients of correlation up to 0.9). In contrast, the correlation between enzymes and creatinine excretion was low in all age groups.</td>

      <td>INTRODUCTION: Long-term sodium balance studies show that sodium can be temporarily stored and released in tissues, mediated by circaseptan rhythms of aldosterone and cortisol. This complicates the reliability of a single 24-h urine collection to estimate individual sodium intake. We investigated whether repeated timed urine collection with and without correction for plasma aldosterone is a more accurate alternative for estimating daily sodium intake.METHODS: We conducted a post hoc analysis of a metabolic ward study in which 16 healthy male adults consumed a diet with a fixed sodium content (50 or 200 mmol/day) for 7 days. Each day, urine was collected in 4 intervals (7:00-13:00 h, 13:00-19:00 h, 19:00-23:00 h, and 23:00-07:00 h). Plasma aldosterone was measured at 6:30 h, 12:30 h, and 18:30 h. Sodium intakes were estimated by various formulas using 3 timed urines of day 5-7.RESULTS: During a 200-mmol daily sodium intake, sodium intake estimates based on three repeated timed urine samples and the Toft equation differed 10 [IQR: 3-14], 8 [6-19], 36 [16-49], and 20 [10-43] mmol from the actual intake for intervals 7:00-13:00 h, 13:00-19:00 h, 19:00-23:00 h, 23:00-7:00 h, respectively. These measurements did not significantly differ from a single 24-h urine (20 [12-55] mmol). During a 50-mmol daily sodium intake, repeated timed urine collection performed worse than a single 24-h urine collection. On both diets, correction for plasma aldosterone increased accuracy and sodium intake estimates were significantly more accurate than a single 24-h urine.CONCLUSION: In a controlled environment, repeated timed urine collection corrected for plasma aldosterone is more accurate than a single 24-h urine collection.</td>

      <td>The investment into the design of a study is usually and unfortunately proportional to the available information, i.e. the less one knows the more one is tempted to skimp and perform a minimal 'pilot' study. This is particularly true with respect to chronobiology. On the contrary, at the outset of a study, when the information available regarding a given problem is minimal or zero, the investment into a first study should be near-maximal. Accordingly, the often wasted 'pilot study' should be replaced by a rigorous chronobiologic lead study. The promise of such a chronobiologic 'guide, leading along a difficult or unknown course' is illustrated by the validation with statistical significance of an about-weekly (circaseptan) and an about 24-h (circadian) rhythm in the melatonin content of the murine pineal. Work around the clock on 48 female Lewis/S rats was avoided. Replication of 6 different circadian times on different comparable animals on consecutive days assessed a circaseptan rhythm more prominent than the concomitantly demonstrated circadian, at no added cost for experimental animals beyond those often used for circadian study and with no work around the clock.</td>

Furthermore, in view of the heterogeneity of FSH forms in the anterior pituitary gland (AP), we also sought to ascertain the effects of aging on the type of FSH produced by the AP. An attempt then was made to correlate possible changes in the synthesis and/or release of FSH with the initial decline in the incidence of regular 4-day estrous cycles in our colony of rats. Virgin rats aged 3, 5, 7, and 9 months, exhibiting 4-day estrous cycles were outfitted with atrial cannulae on proestrous morning. Blood samples were obtained every 4 h from 1400 h on P to 1000 h on E. At 1600 h on E, all rats were killed, trunk blood was collected, and the AP was removed, weighted, and homogenized. The concentrations of FSH, LH, and PRL in plasma and AP supernatant were determined by RIA, while the analysis of FSH isohormones in the remaining supernatant was made by chromatofocusing. At 3 and 5 months of age, 74% and 62% of the rats exhibited regular 4-day estrous cycles, respectively. This percentage had declined to 35% at 7 months and to 16% by 9 months of age. The marked decline in the incidence of 4-day cycles between 5 and 7 months was accompanied by an increased incidence of 5- to 7-day cycles, while by 9 months of age, 38% of the rats exhibited persistent vaginal cornification. In comparison to 3-month-old rats, plasma FSH levels were higher in 5-month-old rats at 1400 h on P and 1600 h on E. By 7 months, not only were plasma FSH levels increased further at these times, but they also were increased at 0600 and 1000 h on E during the secondary FSH surge. By 9 months, the preovulatory FSH surge appeared to be delayed, and the characteristic biphasic elevation in FSH levels on P and E was absent. In contrast to FSH, no change in the profile of plasma LH levels occurred until 9 months, when there was a marked reduction in the magnitude of the preovulatory LH surge. PRL levels were not consistently altered with age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</td>

      <td>Increased sugar intake and taste dysfunction have been reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic disorder characterized by diarrhea, pain, weight loss and fatigue. It was previously unknown whether taste function changes in mouse models of IBD. Mice consumed dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) during three 7-day cycles to induce chronic colitis. DSS-treated mice displayed signs of disease, including significant weight loss, diarrhea, loss of colon architecture, and inflammation of the colon. After the last DSS cycle we assessed taste function by recording electrophysiological responses from the chorda tympani (CT) nerve, which transmits activity from lingual taste buds to the brain. DSS treatment significantly reduced neural taste responses to natural and artificial sweeteners. Responses to carbohydrate, salt, sour or bitter tastants were unaffected in mice with colitis, but umami responses were modestly elevated.

      <td>Increased sugar intake and taste dysfunction have been reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic disorder characterized by diarrhea, pain, weight loss and fatigue. It was previously unknown whether taste function changes in mouse models of IBD. Mice consumed dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) during three 7-day cycles to induce chronic colitis. DSS-treated mice displayed signs of disease, including significant weight loss, diarrhea, loss of colon architecture, and inflammation of the colon. After the last DSS cycle we assessed taste function by recording electrophysiological responses from the chorda tympani (CT) nerve, which transmits activity from lingual taste buds to the brain. DSS treatment significantly reduced neural taste responses to natural and artificial sweeteners. Responses to carbohydrate, salt, sour or bitter tastants were unaffected in mice with colitis, but umami responses were modestly elevated. DSS treatment modulated the expression of receptor subunits that transduce sweet and umami stimuli in oral taste buds as a substrate for functional changes. Dysregulated systemic cytokine responses or dysbiosis that occurs during chronic colitis may be upstream from changes in oral taste buds. We demonstrate for the first time that colitis alters taste input to the brain, which could exacerbate malnutrition in IBD patients.</td>

      <td>Balancing wobbles in the body sodium</td>
      <td>Sodium balance is achieved within a matter of days and everything that enters should come out; sodium stores are of questionable relevance and sodium accumulation is accompanied by weight gain. Careful balance studies oftentimes conflicted with this view, and long-term studies suggested that total body sodium (TBNa) fluctuates independent of intake or body weight. We recently performed the opposite experiment in that we fixed sodium intake for weeks at three levels of sodium intake and collected all urine made. We found weekly (circaseptan) patterns in sodium excretion that were inversely related to aldosterone and directly related to cortisol. TBNa was not dependent on sodium intake, but instead exhibited far longer (greater than or equal to monthly) infradian rhythms independent of extracellular water, body weight or blood pressure. To discern the mechanisms further, we delved into sodium magnetic resonance imaging (Na-MRI) to identify sodium storage clinically. We found that sodium stores are greater in men than in women, increase with age and are higher in hypertensive than normotensive persons. We have suggestive evidence that these sodium stores can be mobilized, also in dialysis patients. The observations are in accordance with our findings that immune cells regulate a hypertonic interface in the skin interstitium that could serve as a protective barrier. Returning to our balance studies, we found that due to biological variability in 24-h sodium excretion, collecting urine for a day could not separate 12, 9 or 6 g/day sodium intakes with the precision of tossing a coin. Every other daily urine sampling correctly classified a 3-g difference in salt intake less than half the time, making the gold standard 24-h urine collection of little value in predicting salt intake. We suggest that wobbles in expected outcomes can lead to novel clinical insights even with respect to banal salt questions.</td>

      <td>All Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) records for 1983 from the University of Illinois Emergency Room were collected: a total of 264 drug-overdose (DOD) admissions. Cosinor, multiple linear regression, cross-tab multivariate, and spectral periodicity statistical analyses were performed on the raw data with particular use made of the BMDP statistical package. More DODs present themselves for admission to the ER around the 1820 hr than any other time of the circadian period. Sex, age, and race have no effect on this circadian relationship. No circatrigintan rhythms were found for any sex, race, or age group. However, there is a circannual rhythm for total DOD admissions with more admissions in late July than any other time of the year. Women, however, appear to exhibit a significantly earlier annual acrophase (late May) than males in early August. There is no evidence for circannual, circadiseptan, circaseptan or circabiseptan rhythms for blacks or hispanics. However, whites, particularly males, show evidence of biweekly (i.e., Monday and Friday) as well as circannual rhythms. Multivariate analyses of circannual rhythms vs. age indicated no significant rhythms for the under-21-year-old but a highly significant circannual rhythm for the over-20-year-old. Therefore, ER personnel should be attentive to the sex, age, and race of their patients in order to gain a degree of predictability as to when the greatest number of patients might present themselves at the ER for treatment of their DOD. Awareness of the temporal effects on DOD admissions can thus improve the quality of ER treatment for DOD patients.</td>

Variations in T3 and TSH concentrations among the different months of experiments period were not significant, although T4 concentration was significantly higher during September, October and November in comparison to December and January. Weekly variations in serum T4 and TSH concentrations were directly correlated to the changes in photoperiod and temperature. Monthly variation in serum T3 and TSH did not have a significant (p&gt;0.05) relationship with the changes in photoperiod and temperature, but there was a highly significant positive relationship between serum T4 and temperature. This study showed that T4 concentration was high in the early phase but decreased in the late phase of the breeding season, but T3 and TSH concentrations varied markedly from week to week. However, it appears that weekly rhythms are controlled by photoperiod and temperature because, changes in these factors resulted in different profiles of both T4 and TSH, but there was not any correlation between T3 and those factors.</td>

      <td>The weekend effect of the canopy urban heat island (UHI) has been long recognized. However, how the UHI weekend effect (UWE) varies with the hour of day and season of year is still unclear; it remains largely unknown on how the UWE is regulated by various controls. To address these knowledge gaps, here we took Beijing, China as an example and investigated the detailed spatiotemporal UWE patterns and the major regulators with a 3-year data set of in-situ surface air temperatures. Our results indicate that the annual Delta I-c (the UHI intensity difference on weekends and weekdays) is stronger at night (-0.13 +/- 0.12 K; mean +/- 1 STD) than during the day (-0.05 +/- 0.10 K); at the seasonal scale, Delta I-c reaches the strongest in winter (-0.14 K) and the weakest in summer (-0.05 K). The Delta I-c is strongly regulated by anthropogenic heat flux (AHF), evidenced by a quasi-synchronous diurnal pattern between Delta I-c and Delta HF (i.e., the AHF difference between weekends and weekdays). The nighttime Delta I-c is intensely modulated by urban morphology, with a stronger modulation by the landscape shape index than by the distance of the station from the urban center. Weather conditions also modulate the Delta I-c, with the Delta I-c weakening with the increase of cloud coverage and wind speed level. We consider these findings deepen our understanding of the weekly rhythms of UHI as well as the underlying modulators.</td>

Multiple logistic and linear regression methods were performed as statistical analyses.RESULTS: Oocyte pickup on Tuesdays achieved a significantly higher mean number of oocytes (median: 7) and the highest pregnancy rate (PR) (33.4%) per ET There was a significant variation over the year, with the lowest PR/ET in July (25.71%) and the highest in December (35.5%). Concerning outcomes, the age factor and the number of embryos transferred had the highest significant (p &lt; 0.0001) influence.CONCLUSIONS: The observed weekly rhythm for oocyte pick-ups is certainly due to preprogrammed ovarian stimulation used in our IVF programs.

Herein, using the same data, 7-d (circaseptan) rhythms are also shown to characterize the luminescence of this cellular organism. A fraction of a culture of G. polyedra, grown in 12 h of light (L), alternating with 12 h of darkness (D), was exposed for 3 d to an LD-shift by 11 h. The circadian glow rhythm was compared under free-running conditions (LL) for cultures previously kept on the two differing LD regimens and for mixed cultures. A circaseptan modulation of the circadian amplitude is detected in cultures that had not undergone an LD shift and in some of the mixed cultures, but not in the shifted cultures. A statistically significantly lower circaseptan amplitude (less than 50%) and acrophase advance of over 120 degrees or 56 h (p less than 0.001) characterizes the mixed cultures, as compared to the original unshifted cultures, a finding that could mean that G. polyedra communicates along a circaseptan frequency. Whether a prior phase-shift known to affect circaseptan behavior in another unicell, Acetabularia mediterranea, led to an alteration of the time structure of G. polyedra remains an interesting subject for further study in this model, a model attractive to students of unicellular rhythms and underlying mechanisms that henceforth should be studied at multiple circadian and circaseptan frequencies. Circadian and circaseptan interrelations can both serve as markers for mechanisms of intercellular communication.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Publications on the temporal pattern of the occurrence of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) have produced conflicting results. Variations between studies may relate to the relatively small numbers of SAH cases analyzed, including those in meta-analyses.METHODS: We identified all cases of SAH from 3 well-designed population-based studies in Australia (Adelaide, Hobart, and Perth) and New Zealand (Auckland) during 3 periods between 1981 and 1997. The diagnosis of SAH was confirmed with CT, cerebral angiography, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, or autopsy in all cases. Information on the time of occurrence of each event was obtained. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs were calculated using Poisson regression, with age, sex, smoking status, and history of hypertension entered in the model as covariates.RESULTS: A total of 783 cases of SAH were registered. Age- and sex-adjusted RRs of SAH occurrence were highest in the period between 6 AM and 12 MIDNIGHT (RR 3.2, 95% CI 2.4-4.3) and in winter and spring (RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5; RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5; respectively). No particular pattern of SAH occurrence was observed according to the day of the week. Restriction of the analyses to proved aneurysmal SAH did not substantially change the point estimates.CONCLUSIONS: Circadian and circaseptan (weekly) fluctuations of SAH occurrence in the southern hemisphere are similar to those in the northern hemisphere, but the occurrence of SAH in Australasia exhibits clear seasonal (winter and spring) peaks.</td>

Demographic and epidemiological data including date and time of onset and activity at onset and clinical data were collected. Meteorological data for typhoon's approaches to the Yaeyama Islands were obtained from the web-site of the Japan Meteorological Agency. In addition, patients who had developed SAH during a period of 3 days before and after the closest approach of a typhoon (CAT) were examined.Results: A total of 94 patients were identified. A monthly peak in August, a weekly peak on Monday, and two daily peaks in the evening and morning were observed. The incidence of SAH during a period of 3 days before and after the CAT was approximately twice as high as that on other days, and a statistically significant difference was found.Conclusion: Periodic patterns of SAH onset revealed unusual monthly and circaseptan variations and the usual circadian variation. SAH onset was associated with typhoon's approaches. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

      <td>Psychological procedures, such as self-hypnosis in the form of autogenic training, have been proposed for correcting a deviant, e.g., high blood pressure (BP). In view of the overwhelming evidence for the circadian (CD) stage dependence of any treatment effects, the CD stage dependence of the effects of diaphragmatic breathing (DB) on BP and heart rate (HR) was explored in data from a clinically healthy normotensive subject who, following 3 weeks of ambulatory monitoring as a reference standard, measured BP and HR with a manual monitor at 1-min intervals for 5 min before and after DB (three deep diaphragmatic breaths) and who performed DB for about 2 weeks at about 2-h intervals while awake. The 3-week data series were analyzed by cosinor, involving the least-squares fit of cosine curves with periods of 24, 12 and 168 h. A CD rhythm was detected for BP and HR (P &lt; 0.001 in each case), peaking in the afternoon. Some about-weekly (circaseptan; CS) BP rhythms and 12-h (circasemidian) components were also statistically significant. DB was found to reduce systolic (S) BP. Overall, SBP decreased by 5.9 +/- 0.8 mmHg (P &lt; 0.001) and diastolic (D) BP by 1.4 +/- 0.8 mmHg (P &lt; 0.005), while HR remained at about the same average. The effect of DB on BP was CD-dependent, the largest response occurring in the afternoon, 2-3 h before the peaks in SBP and DBP found in the reference data of the same subject. There was also a 5-10% decrease in SBP around the weekend (Friday, Saturday and Sunday). The results on a single subject suggest the need to collect similar data on others for optimizing by clock-hour, day of the week, and eventually by the marker rhythms BP and/or HR the best times for DB and other procedures. The personalized best time for people on different work/rest schedules for relaxation may be several hours before their BP has reached its highest point in the 24-h span. HR may serve as a marker for DB timing, but the effect on HR of DB was only of borderline statistical significance in the subject investigated.</td>

      <td>Weekly rhythms of urban heat islands: A multicity perspective</td>
      <td>Investigating the weekly rhythms of urban heat islands (UHIs) is critical for gaining deep insights into the urban climate changes caused by periodic cycles of human activities. However, the weekly rhythms of both canopy and surface UHIs (termed I-c and I-s) remain poorly understood at a large spatial scale. Leveraging daily screen-level air temperature (T-a) and satellite land surface temperature (T-s) observations (2015 similar to 2020), we show that the weekly rhythms of I-c averaged for all selected cities exhibit an evident peak-and-valley pattern across most seasons, with the annual mean I-c reduction during weekends of 0.09 +/- 0.01 K (mean +/- S.E., p &lt; 0.05) for daytime and 0.10 +/- 0.01 K (p &lt; 0.05) for nighttime when compared to weekdays. In contrast, the I-s only displays a pronounced weekly rhythm during winter daytime, with the corresponding I-s reduction during weekends of 0.07 +/- 0.01 K (p &lt; 0.05) relative to weekdays. These findings remain robust against potential observation errors in T-a and T-s. From an intra-city perspective, both I-c and I-s reductions during weekends escalate with increasing urban impervious surface percentage. This study illustrates the significance of short-term cycles of human activities in shaping global urban climates.</td>

      <td>This paper uses the Kuhn-Tucker demand system modeling technique to investigate the capacity of a typical week in capturing rhythms in activity-travel behavior. It considers all possible activity types within a weeklong modeling time frame. Complex interactions in time expenditure between at-home and out-of-home activities and among different out-of-home activities are captured by introducing behavioral elements in the model in terms of baseline preference, time translation, and satiation effects. The Kuhn-Tucker demand system model used in this paper is a random utility maximization model with the inherent assumption that every individual maximizes total utility in allocating time to the activities under consideration within the modeling time frame. Models are developed for each individual week of a 6-week travel diary drawn from the MobiDrive data set for Karlsruhe and Halle, Germany. Each model contains 83 variables and reveals behavioral details of complex activity-travel behavior. Based on the performances of the models in terms of fitting observed data and parameter values of specific variables, it is clear that a modeling time frame for a typical week is capable of capturing the rhythms of activity-travel behavior sufficiently. The paper concludes with the recommendation that the availability of activity diary data for a multiweek time period would further enhance understanding on this issue.</td>

In the outer shell layer along the axis of maximum growth, two types of growth increments were observed: distinct increments and indistinct increments, which, respectively, do and do not continue to the middle shell layer. The distinct increments were found to be formed every two days in intertidal and shallow subtidal zones by field enclosure experiments of juveniles with datum points marked with alizarin complexone. Growth patterns of juveniles (12 mm SL) collected from the Seaside Park of Yokohama in Tokyo Bay were analyzed to confirm the modified method. Mean daily shell growth rate from April to July 2005 ranged 120-142 mu m/day, which was reasonable as compared with previous studies. It was impossible to backcalculate the growth to the settlement size (i.e. 0.2 mm SL) because of erosion of the outer shell surface, and the smallest backcalculated minimum shell length was 0.8 mm. Fluctuations in daily growth rate were high, ranging 29-315 mu m/day, and did not show a clear two-weekly rhythm.</td>

      <td>Many travel surveys used in transportation planning still collect information over a single weekday while mobility and activity patterns fluctuate from day to day. However, the emergence of new continuous data sources has led to the generation of large amounts of longitudinal data. Therefore, this paper aims to value these two data types to cross-analyze the temporal variability of aggregated travel behaviors. A weighting method based on large-scale single-day survey samples was first developed to extend the representativeness of the daily trip diaries available in the three most recent Origin-Destination household travel surveys of Montreal, Canada, to the entire data collection period (four months in the fall). This method was then validated using passive data streams (smart card and count data) for three modes: car, subway, and bicycle. The variations in the daily use of these modes measured independently by the surveys and passive data were compared over several months of the fall period and throughout an average week. Indicators were also proposed to evaluate whether the two data sources capture the same trend and seasonality, especially the weekly rhythms. The results show that it is possible to accurately infer day-to-day variability in travel behavior from a large-scale cross-sectional single-day survey. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the potential for complementarity between traditional surveys and emerging data (at least over the survey period), as well as the possibility to combine them since there are large similarities in the aggregated travel patterns they allow monitoring.</td>

The mixed filter bed was composed of seashells, ceramic brick fragments, and sand.

Phosphorus removal exceeded values reported in the literature for both phases, primarily due to the calcium present in the seashells, which increased the electrical conductivity and hardness of the effluent compared to the influent.

Incidence of trauma was positively correlated with average temperature (r=0.512, P&lt;0.001) and atmospheric pressure (r=0.332, P=0.010) and negatively correlated with air pollutants (particulate matter less than 2.5 μm3 [PM2.5], r=-0.629, P&lt;0.001; particulate matter less than 10 μm3 [PM10], r=-0.679, P&lt;0.001). ISS was not significantly correlated with climate parameters and air pollutants, and variability was observed in the frequency and severity of trauma by time of day (highest occurrence, 16-20 pm; highest ISS, 4-8 am), day of the week (highest occurrence and highest ISS, Saturday), month of the year (highest occurrence, July; highest ISS, November), and season (highest incidence, summer; highest ISS, autumn).Conclusion: The study shows a positive relationship between trauma occurrence and specific weather conditions, such as atmospheric temperature and pressure. There was a negative relationship between concentrations of PM2.5 or PM10, and trauma occurrence. However, no correlation was observed between weather conditions or the concentrations of air pollutants and ISS. In addition, seasonal, circaseptan, and circadian variations exist in trauma occurrence and severity. Thus, we suggest that evaluation of a larger, population-based data set is needed to further investigate and confirm these relationships.</td>

      <td>Seven-day cycles in spontaneous activity were found in wild animals (recently trapped Norway rats, chipmunks, ground squirrels, and squirrel monkeys), but not in tame domesticated animals (laboratory Norway rats and hamsters). This 7-day cycle turned out to be a function of emotional reaction of the wild animals to hitherto overlooked slight differences in activities of relevant human beings between weekdays and weekends. Elimination of ability of wild animals to react to slight environment differences by blinding or deafening abolished the 7-day cycles. No definite evidence has been found for the presence of inherent 7-day cycles in animals or man.</td>

      <td>Impact of a humanmade disaster on the utilization pattern of a psychiatric emergency service.</td>
      <td>In May 1980, Liberty City Miami, a black area, suffered a humanmade disaster: a riot. The effects of the riot on the utilization pattern of the only psychiatric emergency service (PES) for the Liberty City catchment area were studied in two ways: autocorrelation and cross-correlation analyses were used to determine whether PES presentations demonstrated a 7-day cycle and whether this cycle was disturbed by the riot; and analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to compare numerically the riot week to the preceding week, the riot week to the following 12 weeks, and the 12 pre-riot weeks to the 12 post-riot weeks. Black PES presentations did not demonstrate a statistically discernable cycle, and none of the ANOVAs were statistically significant. It was concluded that the riot did not have a significant psychiatric morbidity effect as measured by PES presentation data. These results are discussed in reference to previous disaster studies.</td>

      <td>Contributions from both the brain and the vascular network guide behavior in the colonial tunicate Botryllus schlosseri</td>
      <td>We studied the function, development and aging of the adult nervous system in the colonial tunicate Botryllus schlosseri. Adults, termed zooids, are filter-feeding individuals. Sister zooids group together to form modules, and modules, in turn, are linked by a shared vascular network to form a well-integrated colony. Zooids undergo a weekly cycle of regression and renewal during which mature zooids are replaced by developing buds. The zooid brain matures and degenerates on this 7-day cycle. We used focal extracellular recording and video imaging to explore brain activity in the context of development and degeneration and to examine the contributions of the nervous system and vascular network to behavior. Recordings from the brain revealed complex firing patterns arising both spontaneously and in response to stimulation. Neural activity increases as the brain matures and declines thereafter. Motor behavior follows the identical time course. The behavior of each zooid is guided predominantly by its individual brain, but sister zooids can also exhibit synchronous motor behavior. The vascular network also generates action potentials that are largely independent of neural activity. In addition, the entire vascular network undergoes slow rhythmic contractions that appear to arise from processes endogenous to vascular epithelial cells. We found that neurons in the brain and cells of the vascular network both express multiple genes for voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+ ion channels homologous (based on sequence) to mammalian ion channel genes.</td>

The beetles in their natural habitat are confined to the debris zone where they feed on washed up seaweed and this debris zone moves up and down depending on the heights of the tides.

Hemolymph lipid concentrations of emerging worker imagos were analyzed in terms of one ideal synodic lunar cycle and processed by the cosinor method testing the null hypothesis versus the presence of 29.5-, 14.8- or 7.4-day periods in the data. A rhythmicity statistically compatible with a 29.5-day rhythm was observed for triacylglycerols and steroids as well as for body weight. A circadiseptan rhythm was determined for 1,3 diacylglycerols, while fatty acids and phospholipids exhibited a circaseptan rhythm. An agreement of peaks for triacylglycerols, steroids and body weight at the new moon, but not at the full moon, was noted with respect to trehalose and glucose circadiseptan rhythms. The latter moon-phase timing of peaks and nadirs, compared with that previously determined for trehalose and glucose, appeared to be identical to the circadiseptan rhythm and reciprocal for the circaseptan rhythms of 1,3 diacylglycerols. Reciprocal tendencies in circaseptans of trehalose and glucose on the one hand, and fatty acids and phospholipids on the other are indicated. The underlying causal nexus of these relationships is unknown.</td>

      <td>Acute aortic dissection: Microenvironmental regulation</td>
      <td>With the exception of certain genetic connective tissue disorders, acute aortic dissections are still often thought to occur randomly. Very few of these events fall under the genetic category such as Marfan's disease, Ehlers Danlos type IV or Loeys Dietz syndrome and the vast majority follows the rules of other catastrophic vascular events. The evidence is mounting that these catastrophes do not happen at random. This brief review looks at the evidence regarding a circadian, seasonal and weekly rhythm particularly of acute aortic dissections but also other vascular events including their association with emotional stress. The recent surge of interest in aortic diseases and particularly the establishment of the IRAD registry have lead to new insights and clarification of these events. While hormonal associations with vascular events have been known for more than thirty years, modern molecular examinations about regulatory pathways are mostly still lacking. The steering of circadian variation is accepted but poorly understood. On the basis of vascular neuroimmunological observations, speculations regarding micro environmental regulatory pathways are offered.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a transcription factor with antiviral, proinflammatory and tumor suppressor properties. We examined the role of IRF-1 in dextran sulfate sodium colitis, a murine model of inflammatory bowel disease, to determine if absence of the gene would protect against colitis.METHODS: C57BL/6J mice with a targeted disruption of IRF-1 and wild-type C57BL/6J controls received five 7-day cycles of 2% dextran sulfate sodium alternating with five 7-day cycles of water. Colonic tissue was formalin fixed for histological analysis and total RNA extracted for gene chip and SYBR green real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.RESULTS: Histological analysis revealed increased distortion of crypt architecture in the dextran sulfate sodium-treated, IRF-1 -/- animals as compared to dextran sulfate sodium-treated wild-type animals. Five of 15 dextran sulfate sodium-treated IRF-1 -/- mice, but only one of 14 dextran sulfate sodium-treated wild-type mice, developed colonic dysplasia. Microarray analysis comparing colonic gene expression in IRF-1 -/- and wild-type animals revealed decreased expression of caspases, genes involved in antigen presentation, and tumor suppressor genes in the IRF-1 -/- animals. Increased expression of genes involved in carcinogenesis and immunoglobulin and complement genes was also noted in the knock-out animals.CONCLUSIONS: Absence of IRF-1 is not protective in dextran sulfate sodium colitis.</td>

      <td>Lenvatinib is an oral, multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1-3, fibroblast growth factor receptors 1-4, platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta, RET and KIT. Cellular immunotherapy has the potential to be a highly targeted treatment, with low toxicity to normal tissues and a high capacity to eradicate tumor tissue. The present study assessed the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and preliminary antitumor activity of lenvatinib and cellular immunotherapy in a murine model of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The present study used a therapeutic dose of 0.12 mg lenvatinib and/ or 10(4) rat uterine cancer adenocarcinoma (RuCa)-sensitized lymphocytes administered once daily continuously in 7-day cycles. Tumor regression was observed in mice with RCC following treatment with lenvatinib and 10(4) RuCa-sensitized lymphocytes. MTD was established as once daily administration of 0.18 mg lenvatinib and 10(6) RuCa-sensitized lymphocytes. The most common treatment-related adverse effects observed were fatigue (40%), mucosal inflammation (30%), proteinuria, diarrhea, vomiting, hypertension and nausea (all 40%). Combination therapy using lenvatinib and cellular immunotherapy enhanced the antitumor effect induced by single treatments and prolonged the survival of mice with RCC compared with either of the single treatments. Treatment with lenvatinib (0.12 mg) combined with 104 RuCa-sensitized lymphocytes was associated with manageable toxicity consistent with individual agents. Further evaluation of this combination therapy in mice with advanced RCC is required. In conclusion, cellular immunotherapy and oncolytic therapy for cancer may be improved by the synergistic effects of lenvatinib and sensitized lymphocytes. In the present study, the inherent antineoplastic and immune stimulatory properties of the two agents were enhanced when used in combination, which may provide a basis for clinical treatment of patients with RCC.</td>

      <td>Counseling for Insulin Icodec: A Proposed Practitioner's Guide</td>
      <td>Despite insulin being a lifesaving medication, insulin distress, insulin hesitancy, and insulin inertia remain oft-repeated themes in diabetes discourse. The current model lists three issues: temperament, troublesomeness, and technicality, which contribute to insulin perceptions. Therapeutic patienteducation (TPE), value-added therapy (VAT), and medication counseling are concepts that assist in optimizing insulin perceptions. Insulin icodec is a basal insulin with a half-life of 196 h and a once-weekly or circaseptan frequency of administration. Insulin icodec reduces the frequency of basal insulin administration to one-seventh, which along with the lower requirement of glucose monitoring, reduces the burden of plastic and ancillary supply disposal. Because of its unique frequency of injection, insulin icodec usage requires appropriate counseling and education. This reader-friendly counseling guide helps practitioners offer VAT, as well as TPE while prescribing icodec and other insulins.Insulin icodec is a newly developed basal insulin that is injected once a week. Specific counseling is required in order to optimize the use of this insulin. We share a 3T model-temperament [of the person], troublesomeness [of the insulin], and technicality [of injection], that influence insulin perceptions. We then use this model to highlight the information that must accompany an insulin icodec prescription, like value-added therapy. We suggest that as it suits a wide variety of persons living with diabetes, and as its use requires minimal troubleshooting and technical know-how, icodec can be termed a person-friendly insulin. Icodec also reduces the burden of plastic generation and disposal.</td>

      <td>Background and Aims: Mesenchymal stem cells [MSCs] are used in preclinical and clinical studies for treatment of immune-mediated disorders, thanks to their immunomodulatory properties. Cell therapy with MSCs induces multiple effects in the immune system which ultimately lead to increase in the number of immune cells with regulatory phenotype. In this study, we investigated whether the beneficial effects of MSC therapy are maintained in the long term in a clinically relevant mouse model of colitis.Methods: A single dose of adipose-derived MSCs [aMSCs] was infused into dextran sulphate sodium [DSS]-induced colitic mice during the induction phase of the disease. Following a latency period of 12 weeks, mice were re-challenged with a second 7-day cycle of DSS.Results: DSS-induced colitic mice treated with aMSCs showed significant reduction in their colitic disease activity index during the second DSS challenge when compared with non-aMSC treated DSS-induced colitic mice. Strikingly, the long-term protection induced by aMSC therapy was also observed in Rag-1(-/-)( )mice where no adaptive immune memory cell responses take place. Increased percentages of Ly6G+CD11b+ myeloid cells were observed 12 weeks after the first inflammatory challenge in the peritoneal cavity, spleen, and bone marrow of DSS-induced colitic mice that were infused with aMSCs. Interestingly, upon re-challenge with DSS, these animals showed a concomitant increase in the regulatory/inflammatory macrophage ratio in the colon lamina propria.Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate for the first time that MSC therapy can imprint an innate immune memory-like response in mice which confers sustained protection against acute inflammation in the long term.</td>

      <td>In the present study, the neuroprotective effects of dexmedetomidine on rat locus coeruleus were studied during a 5-week intermittent ethanol exposure. Male Wistar rats (3 to 4 months old) were given ethanol or isocaloric sucrose by intragastric intubations three times a day for 4 days, which was followed by a 3-day withdrawal period. This 7-day cycle of ethanol exposure and withdrawal was repeated five times. Dexmedetomidine (at a dose decreasing from 30 microg/kg to 10 microg/kg, s.c.) was given to the treatment group during the withdrawal phase. The results showed that, during the 5-week experiment, dexmedetomidine significantly relieved the ethanol withdrawal syndrome, measured as the sum of the three most specific symptoms (rigidity, tremor, and irritability). The total neuron number of locus coeruleus (LC) decreased in the ethanol-treated group by 24%, compared with the nontreated control group and by 11%, compared with the sucrose-treated control group. Interestingly, the LC neuron numbers were found to decrease in the sucrose-intubated rats as well, compared with the nontreated control group. Dexmedetomidine was found to relieve ethanol-induced neuronal loss in the LC. Dexmedetomidine might be a new interesting alternative in the treatment of ethanol withdrawal syndrome, particularly due to its possible neuroprotective effects in the central nervous system.</td>

      <td>A number of immunological functions has been found to be endowed with biological rhythmicity. Variations of peripheral blood lymphocytes, immediate and delayed hypersensitivity responses, and reactivity of the immune system to antigenic challenge have consistently shown circadian bioperiodicity. By employing a panel of monoclonal antibodies specific for the various lymphocyte subsets, we have been able to detect rhythmic variations in the number of total T lymphocytes, as well as of the T helper (TH) and the T suppressor/cytotoxic (Ts) subsets. Available evidence clearly indicates such circadian variations to be due to compartmentalization of circulating lymphocytes in several lymphoid organs. Biological rhythms (circadian, circaseptan, etc.) have been demonstrated in several immunological situations of clinical interest, including variations of TH and Ts cells in patients with rheumatoid arthritis incidence of allograft rejections, antitumoral effectiveness of chemoimmunotherapy, and allergic symptoms. In addition, the recent availability of synthetic analogues of some thymic peptide hormones and of the synthetic ACTH 1-17 (Synchrodyn 1-17 is greatly contributing to the elucidation of the role of such hormones in the immune regulation process. A preliminary account is reported of the experiments performed with the aim of raising conventional rabbit antisera to the peptide analogue ACTH 1-17, as well as of the consistently negative results which were obtained when 578 human serum samples (from patients treated with such synthetic peptide) were screened by a radioimmunoassay for the occurrence of anti-ACTH 1-17 antibodies. It is emphasized that the recognition of the rhythmic variations of several immunological mechanisms and of the crucial role played by the analogues of adrenal corticotropic and thymic hormones in immune regulation has favoured significant advances in the fast growing area of chronoimmunology.</td>

      <td>Do enamel microstructures have regular time dependency? Conclusions from the literature and a large-scale study.</td>
      <td>This paper is structured in two parts. The first briefly reviews a number of lines of published evidence, including direct experimental evidence, supporting the contention that enamel microstructures are time dependent and have a regular periodicity. The second presents the results of a large-scale study designed to test a central assumption underlying most histological ageing approaches in enamel: that the number of cross striations between adjacent striae of Retzius, called the circaseptan interval, are uniform within a tooth and between all teeth in the dentition of an individual. The study uses a sample of 158 anterior teeth from three modern human populations. Teeth were sectioned and circaseptan intervals were determined by dividing measurements of the distance between adjacent striae of Retzius, by cross-striation length. In order to exercise as much procedural rigour as possible, all measurements were made from photomicrographs. Two sections were taken from each tooth, the sampling location within each tooth was recorded, and all populations included multiple teeth from single individuals. Results statistically validate the uniformity hypothesis within the anterior dentition. These, together with the weight of published evidence, suggest that data derived from the use of enamel microstructures in age estimation techniques and growth and development studies, are valid.</td>

      <td>The spectrum of biological rhythms is extended far beyond circadians, circannuals, and ultradians, such as 1.5-hourly melatonin and 8-hourly endothelin-1 (ET-1) rhythms by statistics of natality, growth, morbidity, and mortality, some covering decades or centuries on millions of individuals. These reveal infradian cycles to be aligned with half-weekly rhythms in ET-1, weekly and half-yearly ones in melatonin, and even longer--about 50-, about 20-, and about 10-year cycles found in birth statistics. About daily, weekly, yearly, and ten-yearly patterns are also found in mortality from myocardial infarctions; the 10-yearly ones are also in heart rate and its variability; in steroid excretion, an aspect of resistance, for example, to bacteria; and in the genetic changes of the bacteria themselves. Automatic physiological measurements cover years and, in one case, cover a decade; the latter reveal an about 10-year (circadecennial) cycle. ECGs, covering months beat-to-beat, reveal circaseptans, gaining prominence in response to magnetic storms or after coronary artery bypass grafting. A spectrum including cycles from fractions of 1 Hz to circasemicentennians is just one element in biological time structures, chronomes. Chaos, trends, and any unresolved variability are the second to fourth elements of chronomes. Intermodulations, feedsidewards, account for rhythmically and thus predictably recurring quantitive differences and even for opposite treatment effects of the same total dose(s) of (1) immunomodulators inhibiting or stimulating DNA labeling of bone in health or speeding up versus slowing down a malignant growth and thus shortening or lengthening survival time, or (2) raising or lowering blood pressure or heart rate in the vascular aspect of the body's defense. Latitude-dependent competing photic and nonphotic solar effects upon the pineal are gauged by alternating yearly (by daylight) and half-yearly (by night) signatures of circulating melatonin at middle latitudes and by half-yearly signatures at noon near the pole. These many (including novel near 10-yearly) changes, for example, in 17-ketosteroid excretion, heart rate, heart rate variability, and myocardial infarction in us and those galactic, solar, and geophysical ones around us have their own special signatures and contribute to a cosmo-vasculo-immunity and, if that fails, to a cosmo(immuno?) pathology.</td>

Among infradian rhythms only the circalunar cycle in women is widely accepted. In our previous studies we have found a circatrigintan (30 days) and a circavigintan (20 days) cycle in men. Whether cyclic patterns with higher frequencies are present in the dynamics of testosterone levels in men or in women is unknown. Aim. To analyze the infradian dynamics of salivary testosterone in both genders for the presence of cyclic patterns. Subjects and methods. Seventeen young and healthy women and 15 men were asked to collect saliva samples during 30 consecutive days. Testosterone levels were determined using radioimmunoassay, Analysis of Rhythmic Variance II (ANORVA II) was used for statistical analysis. Potential period lengths of 3 - 15 days were evaluated. Results. The dynamics of salivary testosterone showed high intra- individual variability in both genders (coefficient of variation - 28% in women and 26% in men). ANORVA II analysis showed no significant rhythms, although a weak circaseptan cyclic pattern has been found in women. Discussion. Our results showed no significant infradian cyclic variation with a period between 3 and 15 days. Further studies should concentrate on potential longer periods. Described intra- individual variability of testosterone levels in both genders should be considered in endocrine research.</td>

      <td>Background A large proportion of admissions to psychiatric hospitals happen as emergency admissions and many of them occur out of core working hours (during the weekends, on public holidays and during night time). However, very little is known about what determines admission times and whether the information of admission time bears any relevance for the clinical course of the patients. In other words, do admission times correlate with diagnostic groups? Can accumulations of crises be detected regarding circadian or weekly rhythms? Can any differences between workdays and weekends/public holidays be detected? May it even be possible to use information on admission times as a predictor for clinical relevance and severity of the presented condition measured by the length of stay? Methods In the present manuscript we analyzed data derived from 37 ' 705 admissions to the Psychiatric District Hospital of Regensburg located in the Southern part of Germany covering the years 2013 to 2018 with regard to ICD-10 diagnostic groups and admission times. The hospital provides 475 beds for in-patient treatment in all fields of clinical psychiatry including geriatrics and addiction medicine. Results Several core questions could be answered based on our analysis: 1st Our analysis confirms that there is a high percentage of unheralded admissions out of core time showing broad variation. 2nd In contrary to many psychiatrists' misconceptions the time of admission has no relevant impact on the length of stay in the hospital. 3rd The predictive value of admission time regarding the allocation to ICD-10 diagnostic groups is low explaining only 1% of variability. Conclusions Taken together, our data reveal the enormous variation of admission times of psychiatric patients accounting for the need of adequate and consistent provision of personnel and spatial resources.</td>

The purpose of this study was to compare topically administered Caphosol to saline rinses in the prevention of mucositis in pediatric cancer patients. Procedure A controlled, double-blinded, and randomized clinical crossover study recruited patients between 2 to 17.99 years of age who were diagnosed with a malignancy and were receiving either high-dose methotrexate (&gt;= 1 g/m(2)), anthracycline, or cisplatin chemotherapy (NCT0280733). All patients received two 7-day cycles of the mouth rinses; that is, one cycle of Caphosol and one cycle of saline in a randomized order. Oral changes and symptoms were evaluated using the World Health Organisation (WHO) toxicity scale and the Children's International Mucositis Evaluation Scale (ChIMES). The primary endpoint was the frequency and severity of OM and oral symptoms. Results A total of 56 patients were recruited to the study, of whom 45 were randomized with a median age of 6.5 years (range 2.1-17.1 years). No cases of severe OM were observed. Grade &gt;= 3 oral symptoms were present at least once in six (13%) patients during the Caphosol cycle and 13 (29%) patients during the saline cycle (P = .12). The peak of symptom scores was evident at around day 4-7 after administration of the chemotherapy with no marked differences between the rinse solutions. Multivariable regression analysis did not indicate a benefit of using Caphosol over the saline solution. Conclusions No difference in prevention of oral mucositis was observed between the use of Caphosol or saline rinses.</td>

In this study, we compared plasma concentration of lactic acid, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and rectal temperature in athletic horses (maintained under a weekly training schedule) with those in sedentary horses (maintained under a constant schedule throughout the week). Although exercise had robust acute effects on the measured parameters, measurements conducted early in the morning or in the evening showed significant weekly rhythmicity only in one of the parameters (plasma concentration of lactic acid) in a few animals. This rhythmicity was feeble, was present only in athletic horses, and vanished if rigorous statistical criteria were applied. In contrast, 24 h rhythmicity was significant in all parameters in all horses. We conclude that the overall 7-day pattern in physiological parameters of the horse is feeble and is caused by the weekly schedule of activity. The available evidence does not support the notion of endogenous, circaseptan rhythms.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to summarize the issues raised during a consensus conference on the role of different blood pressure (BP) monitoring techniques in research, including pathophysiological studies, clinical outcome trials and clinical pharmacology trials.METHODS: This review includes the contribution of the participants in a task force at the Eighth Consensus Conference on Ambulatory BP Monitoring (October 28-31, 2001, Sendai, Japan) and the results of a discussion open to all conference participants. Individual contributions have been summarized together with the points raised during the subsequent discussion, and the main statements are also presented in a table format.POINTS OF CONSENSUS: (1) BP monitoring in pathophysiological studies. The essential role played by continuous BP monitoring in this field had been acknowledged, and further development of non-invasive beat-by-beat monitoring techniques has been advocated. (2) BP monitoring in clinical trials. In clinical trials automated ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) and self BP measurements (SBPM) at home share similar advantages, with specific features that make these approaches not alternative solutions but rather approaches able to complement each other. A few examples of application of ABPM and SBPM in clinical trials include the Treatment of Hypertension according to Home or Office Blood Pressure (THOP) trial and the Trial of Preventing Hypertension (TROPHY). (3) Use of ABPM in clinical pharmacology studies. Use of ABPM is now an established routine, aimed at describing the 24-h effect of new antihypertensive drugs. An example of these applications that was discussed in the conference is the use of ABPM in the evaluation of a new long-acting calcium channel blocker (Barnidipine) (J-MUBA study). (4) Specific models for the analysis of BP fluctuations. The features characterizing the chronobiological approach to description of 24-h BP profiles and its limitations (mainly consisting of the high risk of data over-modelling) are discussed. Also the possible occurrence of a circaseptan (approximately with a 7-day period) rhythm in BP has been addressed, although repeated performance of 24-h ABPM over a week obviously faces a number of practical problems. (5) Progress in technology: BP monitoring and telemedicine. The possibility to implement an interactive telemonitoring system of home SBPM values and the perspectives for a clinical application of this technology in the Hypertension Objective treatment based on Measurement by Electrical Devices of Blood Pressure (HOMED-BP) trial is discussed.</td>

      <td>The Mid-Week Effect and Why Thursdays Are Blue: The Weekly Rhythm of Satisfaction in Hungary</td>
      <td>Research on the weekly fluctuation in people's satisfaction has produced mixed results about the nadir of levels of satisfaction in different countries. This paper uses a Hungarian household survey with approximately 3400 individual observations. The fluctuation in satisfaction over the course of the week is assessed according to the day on which the personal interview was conducted during a six-week period of fieldwork. The analysis investigates the extent to which this is the result of a random process. Unlike previous analysis, the nadir in satisfaction (in Hungary) is found to occur midweek. This is explained as being related to workload. The results are robust after controlling for the interviewers' unobserved characteristics or the hour of completion of the interview. Modification in workdays owing to national holidays did not alter the results. The results reveal which social groups are especially vulnerable to fluctuations in satisfaction. This could have practical consequences for a more efficient work-life balance. The paper suggests questions for future research, which in particular should seek to understand differences between nations in terms of the nadir of satisfaction and to find a solution to the self-selection problem that may result in an underestimation of the true size of the weekly nadir.</td>

      <td>Background and objective: sRaw (specific airway resistance) is a corrected index (Raw multiplied by thoracic gas volume) that describes airway behaviour regardless of lung volume. Normal values of sRaw in adult subjects have never been formally defined. To establish sRaw interpretation criteria and to define a range of reference values, we evaluated variability, reproducibility and reliability of sRaw measurements in a group of healthy adults. Methods: We analysed 517 subjects of both genders, aged 1865 (group A), and to assess the reproducibility of the measurements, we investigated intra-individual variation and potential daily and weekly sRaw rhythms in a subgroup of 18 co-operative healthy subjects (group B). Results: In group A, there was no pattern of association between any of the considered anthropometric parameters; mean sRaw was higher in men (6.24 vs 5.95 cmH2O s in females; P = 0.0128), but when the data were stratified by age, gender-related differences were only found in the group aged 4660 (males 6.45 cmH2O s, females 6.01 cmH2O s; P = 0.0219). In group B, there was no statistically significant, time-dependent variation during the single tests, nor any circadian or weekly rhythm. Conclusions: sRaw is a reliable parameter; therefore, we propose that the lower and upper 95% confidence limits should be considered as reference values for adults of both genders, regardless of age. The availability of reference values may be useful in clinical practice and research.</td>

      <td>This study focuses on flexibly scheduled early childhood education and care (ECEC), an institutional childcare service for Finnish families where both parents, or a single parent, work non-standard hours. Although many countries nowadays offer extended hours day care, only Finland has a publicly provided, law-based system guaranteeing ECEC during non-standard as well as standard hours. We explore, drawing on parental survey data, what kinds of families use such services and when. Furthermore, we utilise web-survey data obtained from early educators to find out what they report as the main challenges involved in implementing flexibly scheduled ECEC. The results showed that single-parent families and lower educated parents were over-represented among the families using flexibly scheduled ECEC. The unpredictability of working-life tends to spill over to ECEC. Due to varying parental work schedules, children have unique daily and weekly rhythms, which in turn impact on administration, pedagogical issues and meeting children?s needs.</td>

      <td>A deeper understanding of drinking practices of a population requires a study of the situations in which people drink, i.e. the context of drinking. This study explores the changes and continuities in the prevalence and nature of drinking in terms of place, company, time and the social drinking context, during a period when overall alcohol consumption in Finland grew by half and drinking culture at large was transformed radically. Analyses were based on two national drinking habits surveys with a representative sample of the Finnish population aged 15-69 years in 1976 (N = 2835) and 2008 (N = 2725). In addition, original semi-qualitative data in 2008 were utilized, using a 15-category social drinking context typology, with the results contrasted to previously reported results from 1976. Overall, the number of drinking occasions increased between 1976 and 2008. A major part of the increase comprised drinking in home settings and with one's partner. The weekly rhythm of drinking was also concentrated on weekends even more than before. Changes in the nature of drinking showed that the typical degree of intoxication decreased for men and increased for women. The proportion of heavy drinking occasions decreased for men especially in home settings and for women, remained the same across drinking contexts except for single gender contexts. Changes in social drinking contexts reflected an overall shifting of drinking into the private sphere, with a major increase in the proportion of evenings at home and sauna drinking.</td>

      <td>The ability to estimate the current mood states of web users has considerable potential for realizing user-centric opportune services in pervasive computing. However, it is difficult to determine the data type used for such estimation and collect the ground truth of such mood states. Therefore, we built a model to estimate the mood states from search-query data in an easy-to-collect and non-invasive manner. Then, we built a model to estimate mood states from mobile sensor data as another estimation model and supplemented its output to the ground-truth label of the model estimated from search queries. This novel two-step model building contributed to boosting the performance of estimating the mood states of web users. Our system was also deployed in the commercial stack, and large-scale data analysis with &gt;11 million users was conducted. We proposed a nationwide mood score, which bundles the mood values of users across the country. It shows the daily and weekly rhythm of people's moods and explains the ups and downs of moods during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is inversely synchronized to the number of new COVID-19 cases. It detects big news that simultaneously affects the mood states of many users, even under fine-grained time resolution, such as the order of hours. In addition, we identified a certain class of advertisements that indicated a clear tendency in the mood of the users who clicked such advertisements.</td>

      <td>Twitter Sentiment About the US Federal Tobacco 21 Law: Mixed Methods Analysis.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: On December 20, 2019, the US Tobacco 21 law raised the minimum legal sales age of tobacco products to 21 years. Initial research suggests that misinformation about Tobacco 21 circulated via news sources on Twitter and that sentiment about the law was associated with particular types of tobacco products and included discussions about other age-related behaviors. However, underlying themes about this sentiment as well as temporal trends leading up to enactment of the law have not been explored.OBJECTIVE: This study sought to examine (1) sentiment (pro-, anti-, and neutral policy) about Tobacco 21 on Twitter and (2) volume patterns (number of tweets) of Twitter discussions leading up to the enactment of the federal law.METHODS: We collected tweets related to Tobacco 21 posted between September 4, 2019, and December 31, 2019. A 2% subsample of tweets (4628/231,447) was annotated by 2 experienced, trained coders for policy-related information and sentiment. To do this, a codebook was developed using an inductive procedure that outlined the operational definitions and examples for the human coders to annotate sentiment (pro-, anti-, and neutral policy). Following the annotation of the data, the researchers used a thematic analysis to determine emergent themes per sentiment category. The data were then annotated again to capture frequencies of emergent themes. Concurrently, we examined trends in the volume of Tobacco 21-related tweets (weekly rhythms and total number of tweets over the time data were collected) and analyzed the qualitative discussions occurring at those peak times.RESULTS: The most prevalent category of tweets related to Tobacco 21 was neutral policy (514/1113, 46.2%), followed by antipolicy (432/1113, 38.8%); 167 of 1113 (15%) were propolicy or supportive of the law. Key themes identified among neutral tweets were news reports and discussion of political figures, parties, or government involvement in general. Most discussions were generated from news sources and surfaced in the final days before enactment. Tweets opposing Tobacco 21 mentioned that the law was unfair to young audiences who were addicted to nicotine and were skeptical of the law's efficacy and importance. Methods used to evade the law were found to be represented in both neutral and antipolicy tweets. Propolicy tweets focused on the protection of youth and described the law as a sensible regulatory approach rather than a complete ban of all products or flavored products. Four spikes in daily volume were noted, 2 of which corresponded with political speeches and 2 with the preparation and passage of the legislation.CONCLUSIONS: Understanding themes of public sentiment-as well as when Twitter activity is most active-will help public health professionals to optimize health promotion activities to increase community readiness and respond to enforcement needs including education for retailers and the general public.</td>

      <td>Background: The study was conducted to evaluate follicular development and hormone patterns with three oral contraceptive (OC) regimens before, during and after the 7-day hormone-free interval (HFI) or 7-day ethinyl estradiol (EE)-supplemented interval.Study Design: The study is a single-center, open-label, prospective, randomized trial to evaluate pituitary-ovarian suppression with three OC regimens containing identical hormones: 30 mcg of EE and 150 mcg of levonorgestrel (LNG).Methods: After a standard 21/7 OC baseline cycle, subjects were randomized to one of three treatment groups: (1) three 21/7-day cycles of 150 mcg LNG/30 mcg EE for 21 days followed by 7 days of placebo (n=10); (2) one 84/7-day cycle of 150 meg LNG/30 mcg EE for 84 days followed by 7 days of placebo (n=12) and (3) one 84/7EE-day cycle of 150 mcg LNG/30 mcg EE for 84 days followed by 7 days of 10 mcg EE (n= 11). Estradiol; follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH); luteinizing hormone and inhibin-B levels, ovarian follicles and daily symptom diaries were collected.Results: Compared to subjects receiving placebo during the 7-day HFI, those receiving EE demonstrated reductions (p&lt;.05) in both FSH and estradiol. Number of developing follicles was less after the 7-day EE interval compared to that after 7-day HFI. Subjects on the 84/7 and 84/7EE regimens reported less (p=.03) daily menstrual flow than those on the 21/7-day regimen. A trend (p=.06) toward reduced headaches during the 7-day EE-supplemented interval was noted.Conclusions: Supplementation of the standard 7-day HFI with 10 mcg EE after 84 days of an extended OC decreased FSH levels and decreased the number of developing follicles.

      <td>Objective: Smartphones have the potential for capturing subtle changes in cognition that characterize preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) in older adults. The Ambulatory Research in Cognition (ARC) smartphone application is based on principles from ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and administers brief tests of associative memory, processing speed, and working memory up to 4 times per day over 7 consecutive days. ARC was designed to be administered unsupervised using participants' personal devices in their everyday environments. Methods: We evaluated the reliability and validity of ARC in a sample of 268 cognitively normal older adults (ages 65-97 years) and 22 individuals with very mild dementia (ages 61-88 years). Participants completed at least one 7-day cycle of ARC testing and conventional cognitive assessments; most also completed cerebrospinal fluid, amyloid and tau positron emission tomography, and structural magnetic resonance imaging studies. Results: First, ARC tasks were reliable as between-person reliability across the 7-day cycle and test-retest reliabilities at 6-month and 1-year follow-ups all exceeded 0.85. Second, ARC demonstrated construct validity as evidenced by correlations with conventional cognitive measures (r = 0.53 between composite scores). Third, ARC measures correlated with AD biomarker burden at baseline to a similar degree as conventional cognitive measures. Finally, the intensive 7-day cycle indicated that ARC was feasible (86.50% approached chose to enroll), well tolerated (80.42% adherence, 4.83% dropout), and was rated favorably by older adult participants. Conclusions: Overall, the results suggest that ARC is reliable and valid and represents a feasible tool for assessing cognitive changes associated with the earliest stages of AD.</td>

      <td>This paper examines the optimization of an existing two-phase anaerobic digestion process using grass silage as a feedstock. The system comprises 6 leach beds connected to an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB). The existing system produced 305 L CH(4) kg(-1) VS added at an overall retention time of 42 days (6 leach beds emptied and fed sequentially every 7 days in series). The desired improvements were a reduction in retention time with increased methane production. It was noted in the existing system that biogas production and COD levels fell off in the last 2 days of each 7-day cycle. Thus the first change involved reduction in retention time to 30 days (6 leach beds fed sequentially every 5 days in series). This lead to a slight improvement in methane production (310 L CH(4) kg(-1) VS added). The second change was effected by separation of flows to the first stage (leach beds) and the second stage (UASB) through addition of an extra pump to optimize leaching. This led to an increase in CH(4) production (341 L CH(4) kg(-1) VS). The overall improvement from the existing system was an increase of 11.8% in methane production and a reduction in size or retention time of 40% (42 days decreased to 30 days retention time).</td>

      <td>The objectives of the current study were to determine whether interspecific sheep&lt;==&gt;goat chimaeras exhibited reproductive cycles of their component species and were capable of maintaining ovine and caprine pregnancies to term. All chimaeras had oestrous cycles and several exhibited characteristics of both ewes and does, including short, 6-7-day cycles. Sixteen caprine pregnancies were confirmed in eight sheep&lt;==&gt;goat and one hybrid&lt;==&gt;sheep chimaera from 21 embryo transfers; of these, six appeared normal by ultrasonographic examination during Weeks 5 or 6, but none progressed beyond Week 8. Three apparent pseudopregnancies developed in two animals. In contrast, eight of 11 pregnancies in chimaeras resulted in term ovine offspring after transfer of ovine embryos or natural matings with rams. By comparison, interspecific (caprine or hybrid) pregnancies in ewes were lost in Week 4 (n = 8) or Weeks 5-6 (n = 2). First interspecific (ovine or hybrid) pregnancies in does were maintained longer (Weeks 6-12, n = 7) than second interspecific pregnancies (Weeks 4-5, n = 5) (P &lt; 0.05) or interspecific pregnancies in ewes (P &lt; 0.05). The results suggest that abnormal fetomaternal interactions during the early stages of implantation are responsible for termination of caprine pregnancies in the ovine or chimaeric uterus, whereas ovine conceptuses are able to implant successfully in the chimaeric uterus. All chimaeras were fertile, since each carried at least one ovine pregnancy to term following natural matings with rams.</td>

      <td>Climate change alters the intensity and frequency of drought and rewetting (D/W) events; however, the influence patterns of D/W on soil N2O efflux in the water-limited area were not fully understood. Therefore, the impacts of D/W cycles varying in different extent of rewetting and frequency to N2O efflux in two kinds of soil on the Loess Plateau were investigated. The incubation conditions consisted of 1) D/ W treatments with four 7-day cycles from 10% water holding capacity (WHC) to 60%WHC or 90%WHC, 2) constant moisture of 60%WHC and 90%WHC. The pulse of N2O efflux rate under 10-60%WHC treatment was higher than that under 10-90%WHC treatment in calcic cambisols, while opposite trend was observed in earth-cumuli-orthic anthrosols. Meanwhile, the pulse of N2O efflux rate decreased as cycle number increased for different wetting intensities and soil types. The direct N2O efflux under 10-60% WHC and 10-90%WHC treatments were 5.49 and 1.89 mg N2O-N g-1 soil in calcic cambisols, with those being 1.92 and 10.85 mg N2O-N g-1 soil in earth-cumuli-orthic anthrosols, respectively. The N loss in earth-cumuli-orthic anthrosols was approximately 5.74 times greater than that in calcic cambisols under 10-90%WHC treatment, whereas the N loss under 10-60%WHC treatment was about 2.86 times greater in calcic cambisols than that in earth-cumuli-orthic anthrosols. This study suggested that extreme rainfall events can enhance the N2O efflux and N loss in agricultural soils on the Loess Plateau in terms of soil type and wetting intensity, which should not be ignored in the N fertilizer management.(c) 2023 International Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation, China Water and Power Press, and China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research.

      <td>Design, Commissioning, and Start-Up of a Sequentially Fed Leach Bed Reactor Complete with an Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket Digesting Grass Silage</td>
      <td>In a wet digestion process, it is necessary to dilute high solid content feedstocks, such as grass silage. However, grass silage tends to be a problematic feedstock for wet digestion due to its tendency to float, to wrap around moving parts, and to cause inhibition to the microbial process due to production of ammonia. Grass silage may be better suited to batch digestion. However, in a batch process, half the feedstock is left behind after each cycle to provide innoculum for the next batch of feedstock. This reduces the effective reactor volume and increases capital costs. A solution is to combine the leach beds with a high-rate reactor. The system employed in this paper is termed a SLBR-UASB and is a two-phase process. The leach beds are the conduit for hydrolysis, and the methane production takes place in the UASB. The leach beds may be emptied at each cycle, reducing the size requirement of the leach beds to 67% of a pure batch system. This paper documents the problems in designing and commissioning a small pilot-scale SLBR-UASB system. The SLBR-UASB showed itself to be a reliable system when the commissioning was completed. A batch test suggested the upper limit for methane production of 350 L CH4 kg(-1) VS added. The recorded gas production when the system was operated as designed was 305 L CH4 kg(-1) VS added (87% of gas production from batch test) at a retention time of 42 days, effecting a volatile solid reduction of 68%. The first 5 days of the 7-day cycle resulted in 86% of CH4 production.</td>

      <td>INTRODUCTION: In the Polish population, the most common cause of allergic rhinitis (AR) in the spring is birch pollen.AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the basic characteristics of the birch pollen season in selected cities in central and northern Poland including Warsaw, Piotrkow Trybunalski, and Bydgoszcz in 2022, considering their clinical implications.MATERIAL AND METHOD: Pollen monitoring was conducted using the volumetric method with the Hirst-type continuous volumetric sampler. Measurements were taken in 7-day cycles, and the microscopic analysis was performed for each 24-hour period. Results During the studied period, birch pollen posed a threat in the 2nd and 3rd decades of April and the 1st and 2nd decades of May. The birch pollination intensity was reflected by the very high values of maximum average daily pollen concentration 4102 pollen/m3 in Warsaw, 4389 pollen/m3 in Piotrkow Trybunalski, 3832 pollen/m3 in Bydgoszcz and the sum of the average daily pollen concentrations (i.e. Annual Pollen Integral, APIn) from 32439 in Bydgoszcz to 37638 in Warsaw, and long periods of exposure to high concentrations (2930 days).CONCLUSIONS: The pollen season 2022 is part of an alternating 2-year cycle of the birch pollen season intensity. The variability of parameters describing the dynamics of pollen seasons over years makes it necessary to monitor information on the pollen concentration in the air during the pollen season, both by the patients with inhalant allergy and their physicians.</td>

We performed a phase I study of ILX23-7553 to determine its side-effect profile, pharmacokinetics, and to document any observed antitumor activity. Patients and Methods Adult patients with refractory solid tumors were enrolled. A modified Fibonacci dose escalation scheme was employed. ILX23-7553 was administered orally daily for three consecutive days, and repeated in 7-day cycles. Plasma drug concentrations were assayed by radioimmunoassay and radioreceptor assay. Results Sixteen patients were enrolled to 10 dose levels ranging from 1.7 to 37.3 mu g/m(2)/day. The maximum tested dose was six times higher than the maximally-tolerated dose (MTD) in dogs. Dose-limiting toxicity was not observed. ILX23-7553 concentrations on cycle 1 day 1 of treatment were comparable to concentrations on cycle 2 day 1, suggesting limited accumulation. One patient with adrenal cortical cancer had stable disease for 23 weeks, but no objective responses were observed. Conclusions ILX23-7553 was well tolerated at the doses tested, with no evidence of hypercalcemia. The plasma concentrations achieved were approximately 100-fold lower than those associated with tumor growth inhibition in vitro, limiting use of this formulation.</td>

This trial was designed to evaluate the cardiac safety of cetuximab as salvage monotherapy in Chinese chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients.Cetuximab was administrated at an initial dose of 400mg/m(2)on day 1 (week 1), followed by a maintenance dose of 250mg/m(2) on day 1 of each 7-day cycle. Electrocardiograph (ECG), routine laboratory tests, and troponin I (TNI) Ultra were performed at baseline, during, and after the cetuximab therapy. The incidence of abnormal ECGs, elevated TNI Ultra, cardiac events, and noncardiac events were recorded and analyzed. TNI Ultra+ was found in 20 patients (32.3%) during the cetuximab therapy.TNI Ultra+ occurred more frequently in patients with more than 3 organs affected and accepted fourth or above lines of chemotherapy. The most frequent abnormal ECG was ST depression in 24 (38.7%) patients. The elevated TNI Ultra and abnormal ECGs could recover after the cetuximab therapy. The most of cardiac adverse events were mild and transient and the noncardiac adverse events were also consistent with the known safety profile for cetuximab.Cetuximab showed its cardiac safety as a single agent for chemotherapy-refractory mCRC patients. And TNI Ultra and ECG could be sensitive and convenient approaches for the surveillance of adverse events.</td>

      <td>Assessing adherence to a rotary diversified diet, a treatment for 'environmental illness'.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: To develop and test a method to assess adherence to a rotary diversified diet (RDD), a treatment for environmental illness, which is a putative disorder characterized by multiple sensitivities to foods, chemicals, or inhalants. The RDD requires the elimination of prohibited foods and rotation of remaining nonprohibited foods and their food families within a 4- to 7-day cycle. The regimen has yet to be validated to the satisfaction of the scientific community.DESIGN: Details of the 2 components of the RDD prescription, elimination and rotation, were documented, and a food record method of assessing adherence was developed. Adherence to the RDD was then assessed in a cohort of women who were enrolled in a larger prospective study. Test-retest reliability of the adherence assessment method was determined by calculating ratings twice on the same set of patient food records, with 1 week between trials.SUBJECTS/SETTING: All patients were contacted through a private environmental medicine clinic in Toronto, Canada. Eight patients provided the food records needed for development of the method; adherence was then assessed in 22 women aged 25 to 67 years.STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Means, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals for adherence ratings were calculated. The reliability of the adherence assessment method was determined by calculating Pearson correlation coefficients for adherence ratings from each trial. A paired t test was also used to determine if the mean differences in ratings between trials were significant.RESULTS: Patients experienced difficulties following both components of the RDD: 37% to 44% of foods consumed were either prohibited or allowed, but were consumed on the incorrect day. The adherence assessment method was found to have high levels of reliability.APPLICATIONS: The adherence assessment method can be used in future evaluations of the RDD, although further testing of the method is recommended. Increased involvement of dietitians with patients diagnosed with environmental illness is recommended.</td>

      <td>Insights into the unique torpor of Botrylloides leachi, a colonial urochordate</td>
      <td>Rough environmental conditions make the survival of many multi-cellular organisms almost impossible, enforcing behavioral, morphological, physiological and reproductive rejoinders that can cope with harsh times and hostile environments, frequently through down-regulation of metabolism into basal states of dormancy, or torpor. This study examines one of the most unique torpor strategies seen within the phylum Chordata, exhibited by the colonial urochordate Botrylloides leachi, which enters a state of hibernation or aestivation in response to thermal stress, during which all of its functional colonial units (zooids) are entirely absorbed and the colony survives as small remnants of the vasculature, lacking both feeding and reproduction organs. Tissue vestiges then regenerate fully functional colony when re-exposed to milder environmental conditions. The whole metamorphic cycle of hibernation and arousal was studied here and divided into seven major stages, during which the anatomical characteristics of the zooids, the blood cell populations and the expression patterns of some stem cell markers were monitored. The first two phases are associated with the shortening of the blastogenic cycles from the typical 7-day cycle to 3-5 day long cycles and with the significant diminution of zooids, leaving a carpet of vasculature. During hibernation this colonial carpet is made of a twisted, opaque and condensed mass of vasculature, loaded with condensed masses of blood cells that possess two types of multicellular structures, the 20-50 mu m morula-like opaque balls of cells, and small single-layer epithelial spheres, blastula-like structures (50-80 mu m). Arousal from hibernation starts with the emergence of several clear tunic areas among the vasculature lacunae, which then turn into transparent buds that become progressively larger and opaque. This is followed by sluggish, newfangled cell movement within the vasculature, which increases in intensity and rate over time. A closer examination of the vasculature revealed dramatic vicissitudes in the blood cell constituency as hibernation progressed, which is manifested by the appearance of two novel cell types not recorded in regular colonies, the multinucleate cells (MNC) and storage cells, each with 2-3 distinct cell morphs. Using mixtures of pre-labeled where half stained with a florescent marker for membranes and half stained for DNA we recorded within 2-3 days from onset new MNC stained by both staining, attesting for the de novo formation of MNC through cells fusion.At the outset of hibernation we documented high expression levels of PIWI, PL-10 and PCNA in cells residing in cell islands (CIs), which are the specific stem cell niches found along the endostyle at the ventral side of the zooids. During hibernation, most of the PIWI+/PL-10(+)/PCNA(+)cells were the MNCs, now located in the newly shaped and dilated vasculature, where they increased in numbers. Also, most of the PCNA(+) cells were identified as MNCs. We further documented that the Bl-PIWI RNA (in situ hybridization) and protein (immunohistochemistry) expressions documented during the hibernation/arousal processes diverged significantly from normal blastogenesis expressions. Counting PIWI+ blood cells at various blastogenic stages revealed a significant increase as the hibernation progressed, peaking in aroused colonies at an average of 30 PIWI+ cells/ampulla. The Pl-10 protein expression patterns in the zooids and buds changed as the hibernation progressed, similar to the PIWI and PCNA expressions. Considering the evolutionary perspectives to hibernation we propose linkages to the disposable-soma theory.</td>

      <td>EXPRESSION AND TRAFFIC OF CELLULAR PROLYL OLIGOPEPTIDASE ARE REGULATED DURING CEREBELLAR GRANULE CELL DIFFERENTIATION, MATURATION, AND AGING</td>
      <td>Prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) is an endopeptidase which cleaves short proline-containing neuropeptides, and it is involved in memory and learning. POP also has an intercellular function mediated through the inositol pathway, and has been involved in cell death. POP has been early considered as a housekeeping enzyme, but the recent research indicates that POP expression is regulated across tissues and intracellularly. In the brain, POP is exclusively expressed in neurons and most abundantly in pyramidal neurons of cerebral cortex, in the CA1 field neurons of hippocampus and in cerebellar Purkinje's cells. Intracellularly, POP is mainly present in the cytoplasm and some in intracellular membranes, like rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. In this paper, we systematically studied the levels of expression of POP along the life of cerebellar granule cells (CGC) in culture and the distribution of POP within different intracellular compartments. We used the tight-binding inhibitor JTP-4819 covalently coupled with fluorescein (FJTP) as a tool to study the changes on expression and localization of POP protein. Our results indicate that POP activity levels are regulated during the life of the neurons. POP was found mainly in cytoplasm and neuronal projections, but at an early developmental phase significant amounts were found also in nuclei. Along the life of the neurons, POP activity fluctuated in 7-day cycles. In young neurons, the cytosolic POP activity was low but increased by maturation so that the activity peak coincided with full differentiation. Over aging, cytoplasmic POP was concentrated around nucleus, but the activity decreased with time. POP was also present in vesicles across the neuron. No major changes were seen in the nuclear or membrane bound POP over aging until activity disappeared upon neuronal death. This is the first time when POP was found in the nuclei of human neuronal cells. (C) 2008 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

      <td>The parallactic view, statistical testing, and circular reasoning.</td>
      <td>A parallactic view (i.e., subjectivity in interpreting data) is an important and perhaps essential tool for formulating hypotheses, but it also represents a hazardous contaminant to be avoided in testing hypotheses. Computer simulations demonstrate that statistical testing of data that are contaminated by even a modest level of such parallax can be very misleading; probability levels are greatly distorted. An even more insidious influence of the parallactic view arises when the fundamental assumptions for a statistical test are not adequately respected. Single-cosinor analysis, which has been used to demonstrate circaseptan rhythms (tau = about 7 days), lends itself to such abuse: The statistical test of the zero-amplitude hypothesis assumes that if any serial correlation is present in the data, it is due to a sinusoidal oscillation with period that is known a priori. One cannot, therefore, legitimately use this method to demonstrate the existence of such a rhythm.</td>

      <td>The best and worst places to live have been analysed in the world for many years and multiple criteria analysis has been used for that purpose. The quality of housing and its environment, pollution, green places, public spaces, physical movement and health, crime rates and individual safety, the wellbeing of youngsters, unemployment, job value, economic scarcity, governance, circadian rhythm, weekly rhythm and other factors are the focus of such analyses that aim to determine levels of positive emotions and happiness in built environment. Questionnaires are the most common tool for such analyses, where inhabitants are asked to rank their happiness experience as a whole in built environment. Many studies demonstrate that happy people are effective in multiple areas of their life including job efficiency, salary, health, human relations, etc. The innovative aspect of this research stems from the fact that biometric technologies (affective attitudes, emotional and physiological states) and the VINERS method developed by the authors are used to determine the best places to live and to serve neuro ads of homes for sale. To do this, rational segments of homebuyers are determined according to their demographic profiles (age, gender, education, marital status, families with children, main source of income), consumer psychographics and behaviour (happy, sad and angry along with valence and heart rate) and then select a rational video ad for such rational segment. The aim of our research is to develop the VINERS Method for the Multiple Criteria Analysis and Neuromarketing of Best Places to Live (VINERS method) by combining the Somatic Marker Hypothesis, biometrics, neuromarketing and COPRAS method. This article presents a case study to demonstrate the VINERS method put to practice.</td>

      <td>In this study, the effects of ethanol and age on the morphology of the locus coeruleus (LC) and on the severity of ethanol-withdrawal symptoms were studied during a 5-week intermittent ethanol exposure. Young (3-4 months) and old (29-30 months) male Wistar rats were given highly intoxicating doses of ethanol by intragastric intubations for 4 days, followed by a 3-day ethanol-withdrawal period. This 7-day cycle of ethanol exposure and withdrawal was repeated five times. A non-treated group and a sucrose-fed group of both ages were used as control groups. The severity of ethanol-withdrawal symptoms (rigidity, tremor, irritability, hypoactivity) was rated up to 62 h after the last dose of ethanol. The intoxication level was higher in the old, compared with the young, rats, despite the smaller doses of ethanol given to the old animals. There was no significant difference between the age groups in the severity of the ethanol-withdrawal syndrome. The LC quantitative studies were performed using unbiased stereological methods. The results showed that there was no difference between the age groups in the LC total neuron numbers of the non-treated control groups. The 5-week intermittent ethanol exposure significantly reduced the LC neuron numbers and LC neuronal density in the old ethanol-exposed animals, compared with the sucrose-fed control animals. In the young rats, the ethanol-induced neuron loss did not reach statistical significance. According to the ANCOVA, the difference in the ethanol-induced LC neuronal loss between the age groups may be due to the difference in the intoxication levels. Interestingly, the sucrose intubations were also found to decrease the LC neuronal numbers in the young rats, compared with the non-treated young control group. It was concluded that ageing did not significantly affect the severity of ethanol-withdrawal symptoms or ethanol-induced loss of LC neurons in Wistar rats.</td>

The data were recorded by 27 participants in a 12-week study, which included a short weight management lecture followed by independent usage of the Wellness Diary. We studied the validity of self-observed weight, and behavioural changes and weight patterns related to weight management success. Self-observed weight data tended to underestimate pre- and poststudy measurements, but there were high correlations between the measures (r &gt;= 0.80). The amount of physical activity correlated significantly with weight loss (r = 0.44) as did different measures representing healthy changes in dietary behaviours (r &gt;= 0.45). Weight changes and the weekly rhythms of weight indicated a strong tendency to compensate for high-risk periods among successful weight-losers compared to unsuccessful ones. These preliminary results suggest that the mobile phone diary is a valid tool for observing weight management and related behaviours.</td>

      <td>Despite the current multimodal approach to treatment of anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), the prognosis for patients with the disease is poor. New effective therapy for ATC is desperately needed. Thus, we investigated the effects of manumycin (a farnesyl:protein transferase inhibitor), alone and in combination with other drugs frequently used to treat ATC, in six human ATC cell lines: ARO, C643, DRO, Hth-74, KAT-4, and KAT-18. By means of a formazan dye-based spectrophotometric assay of cell viability and light microscopy, manumycin was shown to decrease the number of viable cells in all six of the cell lines though to a lesser degree in DRO and C643 cells than in ARO, Hth-74, KAT-4, and KAT-18 cells. In combination, manumycin enhanced the effect of paclitaxel in all six of the cell lines. The mechanism of cell death was investigated by measuring caspase-3 activity, immunoblotting with anti-poly-(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) antibody and electrophoresis of DNA. After an 18-h incubation, manumycin plus paclitaxel caused enhanced activation of caspase-3 activity, cleavage of PARP into Mr 89,000 and 28,000 fragments, and internucleosomal fragmentation of DNA (all of which are characteristic of apoptotic cell death). In contrast, neither manumycin alone, paclitaxel alone, doxorubicin alone, nor doxorubicin plus manumycin produced significant specific cleavage of PARP and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation after 18 h of incubation. The in vivo effect and toxicity of combined manumycin and paclitaxel treatments were evaluated in a nude mouse xenograft model using ARO and KAT-4 cells. Drugs were injected i.p. on days 1 and 3 of a 7-day cycle for three cycles. Both manumycin (7.5 mg/kg/dose) and paclitaxel (20 mg/kg/dose) had significant inhibitory effects on tumor growth. Combined manumycin and paclitaxel treatments seemed as effective as manumycin against ARO cells and more effective than either manumycin or paclitaxel alone against KAT-4 cells. No significant morbidity or mortality was caused by the treatments. In conclusion, manumycin can inhibit the growth of ATC both in vitro and in vivo. Manumycin plus paclitaxel has enhanced cytotoxic effects and increased apoptotic cell death in ATC cells in vitro compared with either drug by itself. The combination of manumycin and paclitaxel is also effective in vivo with no significant toxicity observed. The lack of synergy observed in this in vivo experiment may be due to a ceiling effect, and further experimentation is warranted to ascertain the optimal way to combine these two agents for maximal therapeutic effects.</td>

      <td>Catch-up or compensatory growth is known as a physiological phenomenon. However, most studies of catch-up growth were based on measurements of body weight, whereas changes in longitudinal bone growth remained largely undescribed. The present study describes the dynamics of both weight and longitudinal bone growth using mikro-knemometry, during normal feeding, severe food restriction (starvation), and refeeding of 14 intact and 28 GH-deficient male rats. Starvation induced rapid weight loss (P &lt; 0.001), and stunted leg growth (P &lt; 0.001). Refeeding led to rapid catch-up in weight of up to 4 times above normal daily weight gain, both in intact and GH-deficient animals, whereas an equivalent compensation of lower leg growth remained undetectable. Intact and GH-deficient animals show a circaseptan spontaneous variation of growth velocity (mini growth spurts). During starvation, mini growth spurts disappear, and return to normal after refeeding with no evidence of catch-up. In GH-deficient animals, GH (1 IU/rat, administered twice daily s.c. at 10:00 hand 16:00 h) was capable of augmenting catch-up in weight and, to a lesser extent, in leg length increment.</td>

      <td>Recombinant human interleukin-6 (IL-6) has previously been shown to increase platelet counts in normal and sublethally irradiated mice, dogs, and primates. To assess its tolerance and efficacy in clinical use, we performed a randomized phase Ib study in patients with ovarian carcinoma. IL-6 was administered during an initial 7-day cycle before any chemotherapy. Beginning 7 days later, six cycles of chemotherapy containing carboplatin were administered every 3 weeks. During chemotherapy cycles 2 to 6, IL-6 was administered from day 4 through day 17 at escalating dose levels from 0.5 to 10 micrograms/kg/d. At each level, three patients received IL-6 and one patient received a placebo. During the prechemotherapy cycle of IL-6, a dose-dependent increase in platelet count was observed from day 12 to 15 and was maximal on day 15 (r = .77; P &lt; .01). The median ploidy of bone marrow megakaryocytes shifted from 16 N to 32 N after 7 days of the initial prechemotherapy IL-6 administration. Dose-dependent increases in C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen levels were observed on day 8 (P &lt; .0001 for both). A significant decrease in hemoglobin level occured rapidly after initiation of IL-6 therapy and was maximal on day 8 (P &lt; .001). When given after chemotherapy, IL-6 accelerated platelet recovery after chemotherapy cycles 2 to 6. Postponements of scheduled chemotherapy due to thrombocytopenia were less frequent in patients treated with IL-6. No difference in either neutrophils or peripheral blood progenitor assays was observed during or after IL-6 treatment. Toxicity of IL-6 appeared mild and was not dose-limiting up to 10 micrograms/kg/d. Systemic symptoms such as fever, headache, and myalgia were the main side effects and were easily relieved by acetaminophen administration. No biologic toxicity was observed. The data indicate that IL-6 is a well-tolerated cytokine and capable of accelerating platelet recovery in patients receiving chemotherapy.</td>

      <td>Objectives: This study investigated the efficacy of theobromine in comparison with 0.05% sodium fluoride solution for remineralization of initial enamel caries lesions (IECLs). Materials and Methods: Ninety non-carious extracted premolars were sectioned longitudinally into buccal and lingual segments. Caries-like lesions were induced in each segment using acidified gel. Forty-five buccal segments were used for surface microhardness (SMH) test, and 45 buccal segments were used for energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The lingual segments were used as the control group for EDS and SMH test. The baseline SMH was measured with a Vickers hardness tester, and the baseline calcium content was analyzed by EDS. Each test group was divided into three subgroups for treatment with (1) artificial saliva, (2) 1.1 mol/L theobromine, and (3) 0.05% sodium fluoride. Remineralization and demineralization were done by daily pH cycling to simulate the oral environment. Samples in each group were immersed in treatment solutions for 1 min before and after the remineralizing cycle. After a 7-day cycle, the SMH test and EDS analysis were performed again. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, Tukey's post-hoc test, and paired sample t-test (P&lt;0.05). Results: All treatments effectively remineralized the IECLs (P&lt;0.05), and theobromine caused the maximum increase in SMH, which was significantly higher than the value in sodium fluoride group (mean value of 36.56±4.95 versus 23.25±3.92; P=0.000). EDS showed the highest calcium deposition in theobromine group (3.82±1.83wt%). Conclusion: Theobromine is an effective cariostatic agent, and can be considered as a safe alternative to fluoride in preventive dental care.</td>

      <td>Background/Aim: Several studies have found elevated soluble CD40 Ligand (sCD40L) in the serum of patients with malignancies as well as those with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our goal was to determine the possible causal role of sCD40L in colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) by using the well-established azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS) protocol. Materials and methods: Twelve wild type (WT) and twelve TLR4 knock out (KO) female C57BL6 mice were divided into 4 experimental groups. Six WT and six TLR4 KO mice were treated with a single intraperitoneal dose (10 mg/kg of body weight) of AOM followed by three 7-day cycles of oral 2.5% DSS. The other two groups included 6 WT and 6 TLR4 KO mice that received only water and served as the control groups. The mice were sacrificed after 84 days. Results: All mice in the AOM/DSS WT group developed CAC while all mice from the AOM/DSS TLR4 KO group were protected from CAC. We measured the serum and pathologic tissue levels of sCD40L with quantitative sandwich enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and found that serum sCD40L was significantly higher in wild-type mice that developed CAC compared to their healthy counterparts (wild-type and TLR-4 KO controls). In comparison, serum sCD40L levels were comparable between TLR-4 KO mice, which are protected from developing CAC, and their healthy counterparts ( wild-type and TLR-4 KO controls). Of note, tissue levels of sCD40L were not affected by the development of CAC. Conclusion: Our findings point to the presence of an axis between TLR-4 and sCD40L, which may lead to decreased immunosurveillance and the subsequent development of colitis-associated cancer.</td>

The in vitro data presented show that the catheter can provide antimicrobial activity for 90 days, after being replated for 15 7-day cycles of replating. When the catheters were immersed in human serum and incubated at 37 degrees C, they demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity after more than 325 days of incubation.

Because of practicality only, the relation of circasemiseptan and circaseptan chronome components to circadian components was here explored as a hint that much information lies in the relations among rhythms with different frequencies, for oncologists in particular.</td>

      <td>Carbon dioxide flux in the centre of Lodz, Poland - analysis of a 2-year eddy covariance measurement data set</td>
      <td>Continuous measurements of carbon dioxide turbulent flux F-CO2 carried out with the eddy covariance method have been made in Lodz since F-CO2 July 2006. The measurement point (Lipowa Station) is located in the west part of the densely built-up city centre, where artificial surfaces clearly prevail over natural terrain. The measurement system includes a Kipp and Zonen's (Delft, Holland) CNR1 net radiometer, RMYoung (Traverse City, Michigamn, USA) 81000 sonic anemometer and Li-cor (Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) 7500 open path H2O/CO2 infrared gas analyser. Sensors are installed on the high tower 20 m above the roof of the building and 37 m above the ground, so the measurement height exceeded the urban canopy layer more than twice. The diurnal and annual variability of carbon dioxide flux for the period July 2006 to August 2008 is analysed in the article. The results show the characteristic features in diurnal and annual courses of F-CO2. Independently from the season, positive (upward) fluxes of the order of 0-15 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) prevail in the data. During the cold season, an increase in turbulent CO2 exchange is observed (F-CO2 quite often exceeded 30 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). This can be attributed to anthropogenic CO2 emissions, which are particularly strong in winter due to, among other things, mineral fuel combustion during domestic heating. The average monthly fluxes are positive in all seasons, which means that emission of CO2 in the surroundings of the measurement point prevails over its uptake. Apart from the season, the maximum flux occurred during the day and the minimum during the second part of the night. Wintertime monthly averaged fluxes are much higher than summertime ones. The observed increase in CO2 exchange during weekdays in comparison with weekends can be caused by the weekly rhythm of traffic in the surroundings of Lipowa Station. Copyright.

      <td>Phosphate and Nitrate Uptake Dynamics inPalmaria palmata(Rhodophyceae): Ecological and Physiological Aspects of Nutrient Availability</td>
      <td>Uptake dynamics of dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP) and dissolved inorganic nitrate (DIN) in youngPalmaria palmata(n = 49), cultivated in a range of DIP concentrations (0.0-6.0 mu mol center dot L-1) and nonlimiting DIN concentration (50 mu mol center dot L-1) under fully controlled laboratory conditions, were quantified in a 'pulse-and-chase' approach over 5 weeks. Two different uptake rates were specified: (1) surge uptake (V-S) after starvation and (2) maintenance uptake with filled nutrient pools (V-M). V(S)for DIP of 1.57 +/- 0.29 mu mol center dot cm(-2) center dot d(-1)and DIN of 15.6 +/- 4.3 mu mol center dot cm(-2) center dot d(-1), as well as V(M)for DIP of 0.57 +/- 0.22 mu mol center dot cm(-2) center dot d(-1)and DIN of 5.6 +/- 2.1 mu mol center dot cm(-2) center dot d(-1)were calculated. In addition, an absolute size of the internal storage capacity (ISC) for DIP of 22 mu mol center dot cm(2)and DIN of 222 mu mol center dot cm(2)was determined. A DIP-to-DIN uptake ratio of 1:10 under V(M)showed a weekly rhythmic uptake pattern, highlighted by a high correlation between DIP and DIN uptake (R = 0.943). V(S)for DIN did not occur under DIP depletion, but uptake rates increased with increasing DIP availability. Hence, DIP availability limited access to DIN, which was also reflected by total dissolvable protein concentrations in sporophytes, which ranged from 10.2 +/- 2.5% to 24.6 +/- 8.0% dry weight depending on DIP availability. Similarly, total dissolvable carbohydrate concentration ranged from 22.1 +/- 3.6% to 54.3 +/- 12.3% dry weight. The data presented in this study open further insight into ecological and physiological aspects of nutrient availability inP. palmataand allow for an optimization in cultivation.</td>

      <td>Effect of directional switching frequency on toluene degradation in a vapor-phase bioreactor.</td>
      <td>A potential method to improve biomass distribution and the stability of vapor-phase bioreactors is to operate them in a directionally switching mode such that the contaminant air stream direction is periodically reversed through the reactor. In this study, the effect of switching frequency (SF) on bioreactor performance and biodegradation activity was investigated at 1-, 3- and 7-day SFs using toluene as a model compound. Rapid losses of biodegradation capacity and serious bioreactor instability were observed in the bioreactor operated at a 1-day SF. It is hypothesized that the frequent dynamic loading conditions at the 1-day SF hindered biofilm development and ultimately bioreactor stability. In contrast, bioreactors operated at the 3- and 7-day SFs achieved overall removal efficiencies of greater than 99% for 72 and 59 days of operation, respectively. Following each air-stream reversal, the bioreactor operated at the 7-day SF required 48 h to fully restore biodegradation capacity in the inlet bioreactor section. The 1-day SF bioreactor required no such reacclimation period. The toluene-degrading activity in the inlet section of the 7-day SF bioreactor dropped by 71% during the 7-day cycle, whereas it decreased by only 11% in the inlet of the 3-day SF bioreactor. These declines suggest that continuous or near-continuous exposure to toluene can inhibit microbial activity. Of the three SFs examined, the 3-day SF yielded the most efficient bioreactor performance by balancing reacclimation requirements with biodegradation activity losses.</td>

      <td>Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the bleeding patterns of an extended oral contraceptive (OC) regimen and management of breakthrough bleeding/breakthrough spotting (BTB/BTS).Study design: This was a single-center prospective analysis of self-rated menstrual flow during a 21/7-day versus a 168-day extended regimen of on OC containing 3 mg of drosperinone and 30 mcg of ethinyl estradiol (DRSP/EE) with institution of a randomized protocol to manage BTB/BTS.Results: Of the 111 patients initiating the extended OC regimen, 102 (92%) completed the 168-day regimen. Subjects having a heavier daily flow rating during the 21/7-day pre-extension cycle had greater daily flow ratings (P &lt; .001) and tended to have earlier occurrence of BTB during the extended regimen (P = .07) than subjects with lighter daily flow ratings. If BTB/BTS of at least 7 consecutive days occurred, patients were randomized to taking a 3-day hormone free interval (HFI) versus continuing active pills. Instituting a 3-day HFI was significantly more effective in resolving BTB/BTS than continuing active pills (P &lt; .0001). Patients with heavier daily flow ratings during the 21/7-day cycle were not more likely to be randomized for BTB/BTS than those with lighter flow ratings (P = .53).Conclusion: A 168-day extended regimen of DRSP/EE had an acceptable bleeding profile with a high continuation rate. Bleeding during the extended cycle was effectively managed with institution of a 3-day HFI. (c) 2006 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.</td>

      <td>The benzamide compound metoclopramide (MCP) protects against cholinesterase inhibition by paraoxon (POX) both in vitro and in vivo. This study evaluates MCP-conferred protection of enzyme activity head to head against the therapeutic gold standard pralidoxime (PRX). Six groups of rats were used. All substances were applied i.p. daily for 5 days, followed by a 2-day rest. The 7-day cycle was repeated eight times. Group 1 received 100 nM POX, group 2 received 50 micro M MCP, group 3 received 100 nM POX + 50 micro M MCP, group 4 received 50 micro M PRX, group 5 received 100 nM POX + 50 micro M PRX and group 6 received saline. Red blood cell acetylcholinesterase (RBC-AChE) measurements were performed at baseline and on day 5 of each 7-day cycle. The sums of enzyme activities over time (weekly values expressed as % of baseline of 100%) were compared using the Mann-Whitney rank order test. A Bonferroni correction of 4 for multiple comparisons was applied. Paraoxon significantly reduced enzyme activities when compared with saline (Sigma = 535 +/- 25 vs 902 +/- 42). Metoclopramide conferred statistically significant in vivo protection from inhibition of RBC-AChE by POX (Sigma = 640 +/- 58). The extent of protection was significantly less than that conferred by the gold standard PRX (Sigma = 765 +/- 57). Metoclopramide, in addition to being less effective as an RBC-AChE protective agent, also caused a failure to thrive in the POX+MCP-exposed rats, as evidenced by the changes in body weight.</td>

After a run-in cycle of 21 days on and 7 days off with AG200-15, participants were randomized to receive one of two treatments: a 21/7-day cycle of AG200-15 either followed or preceded by one cycle of the COC. This trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov under the identifier NCT01243580.Results: During the third week of AG200-15 use, mean (+/- standard deviation) maximum serum concentration (C,), area under the curve(0-168 h) and steady-state concentration (Css48-168 h) for EE were 51.3 +/- 17.3 pg/mL, 6.26 +/- 2.46 ng h/mL and 35.7 +/- 14.5 pg/mL, respectively; for LNG, the corresponding values were 2400 +/- 1140 pg/mL, 317 +/- 159 ng h/mL and 1847 +/- 930 pg/mL, respectively. The AG200-15 EE C-max was approximately 60% lower and the EE C-ss was 15%-20% lower than those obtained with the COC. The calculated daily dose of AG200-15 was equivalent to a 30-mcg EE COC. The most common adverse events (AEs; &gt;10%) in the AG200-15 group were headache, nausea and application-site irritation. All drug-related AEs were mild, and no serious AEs were reported.Conclusions: EE and LNG daily exposure during AG200-15 treatment was within the range reported for a low-dose COC. The daily EE dose with AG 200-15 was equivalent to a 30-mcg COC and was safe and well tolerated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</td>

      <td>Background/Aim: Our aim was to develop an animal model of the precancerous stages of colitis-associated carcinogenesis by modifying the established azoxymethane/ de.kIran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS) protocol. Materials and Methods: Six mice were treated with varying cycles of DSS following AOM administration as above (group 1: three mice received three 5-day cycles of 3.0% DSS and group 2: three mice received three 7-day cycles of 2.5% DSS; every cycle was followed by a 2-week rest period) and were sacrificed on day 84 of the experiment. By contrast, three female C57BL6 mice (group 3) were treated with a single intraperitoneal dose (10 mg/kg of body weight) of AOM followed by three 5-day cycles of oral 2.5% DSS, with each cycle interrupted by a 2-week rest period. The mice of this group were sacrificed at 60 days. Results: In groups 1 and 2, cancer was noted in five out of the six mice. In group 3, adenomas with dysplastic lesions were noted in all of the mice, but none had developed adenocarcinoma. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the administration of three 5-day cycles of 2.5% DSS following an initial dose of AOM may successfully induce adenoma formation without the concurrent presence of carcinoma in female C57BL6 mice that are sacrificed on experimental day 60. In turn, this modification of the widely used AOM/DSS protocol may constitute a novel approach for investigating colitis-related colonic adenomas.</td>

Nine blocks of ACP resin-based sealant were prepared and immersed in three solutions at different pH (4.0, 5.5, 7.0), and calcium and phosphate ion release was measured with ion chromatography at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after immersion. Sixty days after immersion, each block was charged with CPP-ACP solution in three 7-day cycles to investigate the re-release of these ions, which was measured on days 1, 3, and 7. No difference was observed in initial calcium ion release at pH 4.0 and pH 5.5. At both values, ion release was significantly higher than at pH 7.0 (p0.001). Initial phosphate release was significantly different among the three pH values (p0.001). After re-charging the specimens, calcium ion re-release was greater than phosphate ion release. Initial ion release from ACP resin-based sealant was greatest at the lowest pH. Ion release decreased with time. As the number of recharge cycles increased, ion re-release also improved. Phosphate ion re-release required more recharge cycles than calcium ion re-release.</td>

BALB/c mice received an intraperitoneal injection of azoxymethane at 10 mg/kg, followed by two 7-day cycles of 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) administered through their drinking water to induce colon cancer, or a 7-day administration of 4% DSS to induce colitis. The colorectal tissue was then analyzed for gene expression, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry. In the colorectal cancer, AKAP13 and ROCK1/2 were highly expressed in adenocarcinoma compared to the control tissue and low-grade dysplasia. In colitis, AKAP13 and ROCK1 were highly expressed in the restituted and regenerated mucosa but were only moderately expressed in the injured mucosal epithelium, compared to the normal epithelium that exhibited weak expression levels. ROCK2 was weakly expressed in these cells, consistent with the expression of AKAP13 and ROCK1. Furthermore, we found several clumps of epithelial cells expressing AKAP13 and ROCK1/2 in the lamina propria during the mucosal healing process, and these cells also expressed interleukin-6, which is a multipotential cytokine for both inflammation and healing. These data suggest that AKAP13 was expressed in relation with ROCK1/2, which probably play an overall role in both mucosal healing and tumorigenesis.</td>

These data support the therapeutic similarity of rituximab and CT-P10.Introduction: This double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled phase III trial (NCT02260804) assessed CT-P10 and rituximab safety and efficacy in patients with previously untreated low-tumor-burden follicular lymphoma (LTBFL), including after a single switch from rituximab to CT-P10. Patients and Methods: LTBFL patients were randomized (1:1) to receive CT-P10 or rituximab (375 mg/m(2) intravenously; day 1 of 4 7-day cycles). Patients achieving disease control entered a 2-year maintenance period. CT-P10 or rituximab were administered every 8 weeks (6 cycles) in year 1; all patients could receive CT-P10 (every 8 weeks; 6 cycles) in year 2. Secondary endpoints (reported here) were overall response rate (ORR) dur ing the study period, progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS). Safety and immunogenicity were evaluated. Results: Between November 9, 2015 and January 4, 2018, 258 patients were randomized (130 for CT-P10; 128 for rituximab). ORR was similar between groups over the study period (CT-P10: 88%; rituximab: 87%). After 29.2 months' median follow-up, median PFS, TTP, and OS were not estimable; 24-month Kaplan-Meier estimates suggested similarity between groups. Overall, 114 (CT-P10: 88%), and 104 (rituximab: 81%) patients experienced treatment-emergent adverse events. The single switch was well tolerated. Conclusion: These updated data support therapeutic similarity of CT-P10 and rituximab and support the use of CT-P10 monotherapy for previously untreated LTBFL. (C) 2021 The Authors.

The effects of GO doping content on the morphology, structure and surface properties of UF membrane and the final NF membrane were studied comprehensively. The hydrophilic GO acted as a bridge between UF membrane and polyamide layer due to the anchor effect, which significantly enhanced the interaction between base membrane and polyamide layer. The results revealed that with ultra-low GO doping content of 0.05 wt%, the final NF005 membrane exhibited a high selective separation capacity for Mg2+ and Li+ (S-Mg,S-Li approximate to 0.062), and the flux increased by about 119% compared with the pure NF0 membrane. Additionally, due to the high stability of membrane, the excellent separation capacity of NF005 membrane only changed slightly after 7-day cycle filtration test. Importantly, a small amount of GO doping greatly improved the permeability of both UF and NF membranes, which correspondingly improved the separation efficiency and accelerated the filtration rate. This work provides a new direction for designing membrane with high efficiency for Mg2+/Li+ separation, which is potential in the field of lithium extraction.</td>

      <td>Biological treatment of selenate-containing saline wastewater by activated sludge under oxygen-limiting conditions</td>
      <td>Selenium often coincides with high salinity in certain industrial wastewaters, which can be a limitation in the practical application of biological treatment. However, there are no studies on the biological treatment of selenate-containing saline wastewater. A sequencing batch reactor inoculated with activated sludge was applied to treat selenate in the presence of 3% (w/v) NaCl. Start-up of the sequencing batch reactor with a 7-day cycle duration and excessive acetate as the sole carbon source succeeded in removing above 98% and 72% soluble and solid selenium, respectively, under oxygen-limiting conditions. Further selenium removal experiments with a shorter cycle duration of 3 days and a stepwise decrease of acetate addition achieved soluble and total selenium removal efficiencies in most batches above 96% and 80%, respectively. Mass balance analysis revealed that selenate was converted into elemental selenium, most of which was accumulated in the sludge. Microscopic analyses also found that elemental selenium particles were primarily present as approximately 2 mu m large rods, with some extremely large particles above 10 mu m. Although the bacterial populations responsible for selenium removal, especially selenate reduction, could not be identified by microbial community analysis, this study reported for the first time that selenate could be biologically treated in the presence of considerable salinity, offering implications for the practical treatment of selenium in certain industrial wastewaters.

      <td>Speciation dynamics of oxyanion contaminants (As, Sb, Cr) in argillaceous suspensions during oxic-anoxic cycles</td>
      <td>Argillaceous geological formations are considered promising repositories for waste containing inorganic contaminants. However, the sequestration capacity of an argillaceous natural barrier may change as a result of dynamic environmental conditions, in particular changes in redox state. Here, we imposed redox cycles to argillaceous suspensions amended with a mixture of the inorganic contaminants As(V), Sb(V), Cr(VI), by alternating 7-day cycles of sparging with either oxic or anoxic gas mixtures. During the redox cycles, we assessed the relative importance of different contaminant sequestration mechanisms under sterile and non-sterile conditions. The non-sterile experiments were carried out 1) with the argillaceous material as is, that is, containing the native microbial population, 2) with the addition of ethanol as a source of labile organic carbon, and 3) with the addition of both ethanol and a soil microbial inoculum. In order to capture the observed solid-solution partitioning trends, a series of mixed thermodynamic-kinetic models representing the dynamic conditions in the experiments were developed using PHREEQC. Parameter values for processes such as adsorption, which occurred in all experiments, were kept constant across all the simulations. Additional formulations were introduced as needed to account for the microbial detoxification and respiration of the contaminants in the increasing complexity experiments. Abiotic adsorption of As and abiotic reductive precipitation of Cr dominated sequestration of these two contaminants under all experimental conditions, whereas the presence of microorganisms was essential to decrease the aqueous Sb concentration. Once reduced, As(III), Sb(III), and Cr(III) were not reoxidized upon exposure to dissolved O-2 in any of the experiments. Neither the mineralogy nor the native microbiota catalysed contaminant oxidation processes. Thus, kinetically, the reduction of As(V), Sb(V), and Cr(VI) was irreversible over the experimental duration (49 days). The capacity of the argillaceous matrix to reduce and sequester the aqueous contaminants, without subsequent remobilization to the aqueous phase during the oxic periods, supports the use of argillaceous barriers for geologic waste storage.</td>

      <td>Purpose: To evaluate the occurrence of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) in patients exposed to nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (NBPs) requiring surgical tooth extraction.Patients and Methods: Sixty high-risk patients exposed to NBPs underwent surgical tooth extraction with bone biopsy and were treated with a 7-day cycle of oral antibiotics and discontinuation of NBPs for 1 month. BRONJ was defined as the occurrence of any BRONJ stage (0-3) at 3, 6, or 12 months of follow-up. Inferential analysis was performed on a per-bone (maxilla and/or mandible) basis (n=72). The time to BRONJ was calculated, and age, gender, cancer diagnosis, and baseline osteomyelitis were evaluated as potential predictors. Exact logistic regression was used to model the time-to-outcome relationship, and hazard rates were calculated from logistic probabilities.Results: BRONJ was detected at 3 months' follow-up in 4 bones and at 6 months in 1 further bone. In the whole cohort of bones, the hazard rate of BROM was 5.6% at 3 months and 1.5% at 6 months. Baseline osteomyelitis was a strong risk factor for BROM development (odds ratio, 156.96; exact 95% confidence interval, 18.99 to (infinity); exact P&lt;.0001).Conclusion: In this 12-month follow-up study, BRONJ was a rare outcome in high-risk NBP users who underwent surgical tooth extraction. Moreover, baseline osteomyelitis was a very strong risk factor for BRONJ development. (C) 2010 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons J Oral Maxillofac Surg 68:797-804, 2010</td>

      <td>Outpatient feeding studies are being used increasingly more often than inpatient studies because they are less expensive to conduct and less disruptive to participants' daily lives. Frequently, however, they are more difficult to implement. Studies involving multiple feeding centers add an additional layer of cooperation, coordination, and standardization to the already complex task of developing and delivering research diets. This was true for the 4-year Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trial, one of the first multicenter outpatient controlled feeding studies. This 4-center, randomized clinical trial was designed to compare the effects of 3 dietary patterns on blood pressure. After a year of development, 3 sets of 7-day cycle menus that met the study nutrient criteria and that were appropriate for varying food production routines and staffing patterns at the 4 clinical centers were adopted. The major development tasks were: defining methodologies to guide menu design and food production; selecting a nutrient database and calculating nutrient content of menus; evaluating and selecting the menus; and adjusting the menus for final use. The purpose of this article is to describe the steps and considerations in the design and selection of menus for the DASH trial, a process applicable to all well-controlled feeding studies.</td>

      <td>Background Studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and advanced follicular lymphoma have shown that CT-P10, a rituximab biosimilar, has equivalent or non-inferior efficacy and pharmacokinetics to rituximab. We aimed to assess the therapeutic equivalence of single-agent CT-P10 and rituximab in patients with newly diagnosed low-tumour burden follicular lytnpliorna.Methods In this ongoing, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled, phase 3 trial, adult patients W.8 years) with stage II-IV low-tumour-burden follicular lymphoma were randomly assigned (1:1) using an interactive web or voice response system stratified by region, stage, and age to CT-P10 or US-sourced rituximab. Patients received CT-P10 or rituximab (375 mg/m(2) intravenous) on day 1 of four 7-day cycles (induction period). Patients who had disease control after the induction period continued to a maintenance period of CT-P10 or rituximab administered every 8 weeks for six cycles and, if completed, a second year of maintenance therapy of additional CT-P10 (every 8 weeks for six cycles) was offered. The study was partially unmasked after database lock (Feb 23, 2018) for all data up to 7 months (before cycle 3 of the maintenance period). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an overall response by 7 months in the intention-to-treat population. Efficacy equivalence was shown if the two-sided 90% CIs for the treatment difference in the proportion of responders between CT-P10 and rituximab was within the equivalence margin of 17%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02260804.Findings Between Nov 9, 2015, and Jan 4, 2018, 402 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 258 were randomly assigned: 130 to CT-P10 and 128 to rituximab. 108 (83%) of 130 patients assigned to CT-P10 and 104 (81%) of 128 assigned to rituximab achieved an overall response by month 7 (treatment difference estimate 1-8%; 90% CI 6-43 to 10 20). Therapeutic equivalence was shown (90% CIs were within the prespecified margin of 17%). The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events were decreased neutrophil count (two grade 3 in the CT-P10 group) and neutropenia (one in each group); all other grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in one patient each. Six (5%) of 130 patients who received CT-P10 and three (2%) of 128 who received rituximab experienced at least one treatment-emergent serious adverse event.Interpretation CT-P10 was equivalent to rituximab in terms of efficacy and was well tolerated.

We report results from a phase I-II study of fenretinide with rituximab for B-NHLs. Eligible diagnoses included indolent B-NHL or mantle cell lymphoma. The phase I design de-escalated from fenretinide at 900mg/m(2) PO BID for days 1-5 of a 7-day cycle. The phase II portion added 375mg/m(2) IV rituximab weekly on weeks 5-9 then every 3months. Fenretinide was continued until progression or intolerance. Thirty-two patients were treated: 7 in phase I, and 25 in phase II of the trial. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The phase II component utilized fenretinide 900mg/m(2) twice daily with rituximab. The most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher were rash (n=3) and neutropenia (n=3). Responses were seen in 6 (24%) patients on the phase II study, with a median duration of response of 47months (95% confidence interval, 2-56). The combination of fenretinide and rituximab was well tolerated, yielded a modest overall response rate, but with prolonged remission durations.

      <td>Background: Treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemias (Ph-positive ALL) with clinically approved inhibitors of the Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase frequently results in the emergence of a leukemic clone carrying the T315I mutation in Bcr/Abl, which confers resistance to these drugs. PHA-739358, an Aurora kinase inhibitor, was reported to inhibit the Bcr/Abl T315I mutant in CML cells but no preclinical studies have examined this in detail in human ALL.Results: We compared the sensitivity of human Bcr/Abl T315I, Bcr/Abl wild type and non-Bcr/Abl ALL cells to this drug. PHA-739358 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis independently of Bcr/Abl, the T315I mutation, or presence of the tumor suppressor p53, but the degree of effectiveness varied between different ALL samples. Since short-term treatment with a single dose of drug only transiently inhibited proliferation, we tested combination treatments of PHA-739358 with the farnesyltransferase inhibitor Lonafarnib, with vincristine and with dasatinib. All combinations reduced viability and cell numbers compared to treatment with a single drug. Clonogenic assays showed that 25 nM PHA-739358 significantly reduced the colony growth potential of Ph-positive ALL cells, and combined treatment with a second drug abrogated colony growth in this assay. PHA-739358 further effectively blocked Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase activity and Aurora kinase B in vivo, and mice transplanted with human Bcr/Abl T315I ALL cells treated with a 3x 7-day cycle of PHA-739358 as mono-treatment had significantly longer survival.Conclusions: PHA-739358 represents an alternative drug for the treatment of both Ph-positive and negative ALL, although combined treatment with a second drug may be needed to eradicate the leukemic cells.</td>

      <td>Objectives: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical cystectomy (RC) are underutilized standards of care for the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) due to high patient burden from systemic toxicities and postoperative complications, respectively. TAR-200 is a novel intravesical drug delivery system developed to release gemcitabine into the bladder urine continuously, resulting in distribution of drug into stromal layers of the bladder. The primary aim of the TAR-200-101 study was to evaluate the safety of TAR-200 in patients with MIBC prior to RC (NCT02722538).Methods and materials: This phase I, open-label study was conducted across 6 US and European sites. Eligible patients were aged &gt;= 18 years with histologically confirmed T2a-T3b N0-N1 M0 urothelial cancer and had refusal or were ineligible to receive cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. Two arms were enrolled serially. Patients in Arm 1 had residual tumor &gt;3 cm after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT); those in Arm 2 had undergone maximal TURBT (residual tumor &lt;3 cm). Patients received two 7-day cycles of intravesical gemcitabine delivery via TAR-200 before undergoing RC. Primary outcome was safety; secondary outcomes were tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy.Results: Of 23 patients in the intention-to-treat population (11 in Arm 1, 12 in Arm 2), 20 completed both dosing cycles of TAR-200. No patients were classified as intolerant to TAR-200. Ten patients (4 in Arm 1, 6 in Arm 2) experienced &gt;= 1 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). The most common TAR-200-related TEAEs were pollakiuria (n = 3) and urinary incontinence (n = 2). All TEAEs prior to RC were grade &lt;= 2; 1 patient in Arm 2 experienced a grade 3 non-treatment-related TEAE. Plasma gemcitabine levels were undetectable. In Arm 1, those with residual tumor, 4 of 10 patients exhibited pathologic downstaging; 1 experienced a complete response (CR) and 3 a partial response (PR). In Arm 2, those undergoing maximal TURBT, 6 of 10 patients exhibited downstaging; 3 experienced a CR and 3 a PR.Conclusion: Controlled intravesical gemcitabine release via TAR-200 was safe and well tolerated in patients with MIBC.

      <td>Treatment of hairy-cell leukemia: current views.</td>
      <td>Although hairy-cell leukemia (HCL) is uncommon, remarkable progress has been made in the treatment of patients with this disease. Because of their unique mechanisms of action, the purine analogs, 2'-deoxycoformycin (2'-DCF) and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA), are naturally targeted to lymphocytes and are cytotoxic to both resting and dividing cells. Both of these agents induce durable complete remissions (CRs) in the overwhelming majority of patients. Remarkably, equally high rates of durable CR are achieved in both untreated and previously treated patients. Furthermore, patients with large tumor burdens fare as well as those with minimal disease. Therefore, these agents have emerged as the treatments of choice for all patients with hairy-cell leukemia and have supplanted earlier treatments such as splenectomy and interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha). Since a single 7-day cycle of 2-CdA leads to excellent outcomes and is associated with few toxicities other than culture-negative fever, this agent is particularly attractive and may offer some advantages. However, given the indolent natural history of HCL, long-term follow-up study will be required to determine if one purine analog offers a survival advantage over the other.</td>

      <td>Objective: The cardiac safety of cetuximab and panitumumab, particularly as single agents, has not been investigated extensively. This trial was designed to specifically evaluate the cardiac safety of cetuximab and panitumumab as single therapy in Chinese chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients.Patients and methods: Sixty-one patients received cetuximab at an initial dose of 400 mg/m2 intravenously over 120 minutes on day 1 (week 1), followed by a maintenance dose of 250 mg/m2 intravenously over 60 minutes on day 1 of each 7-day cycle. Forty-three patients received panitumumab at a dose of 6 mg/kg intravenously every 14 days. Routine laboratory tests and electrocardiogram (ECG) were performed at baseline, during therapy and after the treatment (4th and 10th months). The incidence of elevation of troponin I ultra (TNI Ultra), abnormal ECGs, cardiac events and noncardiac adverse events (AEs) were recorded and analyzed.Results: The incidence of elevation of TNI Ultra between the two groups had no significance (p= 0.681), and TNI Ultra+ was observed more frequently in patients with metastases to more than three organs and they received fourth or above lines of chemotherapy. The most frequent abnormal ECG manifestations were nonspecific ST changes and QTc prolongation in the two groups. At 10 months after treatment, most of the abnormal ECG manifestations were reversed. The most common cardiac AEs of cetuximab and panitumumab included palpitations, dyspnea, chest pain and arrhythmias requiring treatment. Most of the events were mild and transient. The incidence of cardiac AEs had no significant difference between the two groups. Rash was still the most common noncardiac AE in both groups.Conclusion: Cetuximab and panitumumab showed favorable cardiac safety as single agents for Chinese chemotherapy-refractory mCRC patients. But monitoring for cardiac AEs is still necessary throughout the entire treatment process.</td>

      <td>Fluoride mouthrinse has been used to manage dental caries. Fluoride mouthrinse has often been used at a fluoride concentration of 0.05% sodium fluoride (NaF) solution [225 ppm fluoride (F)] rinse once a day but a lower concentration of fluoride mouthrinse is also available with a concentration of 0.02% NaF (100 ppm F) used twice daily. However, they have no published in vitro studies evaluating the remineralization effect of 0.02% NaF mouthrinse on primary teeth in Thailand. Therefore, we aimed to compare the remineralizing efficacy between 0.05% NaF and 0.02% NaF mouthrinse in order to determine if the remineralizing efficacy is the same between the 2 concentrations in order to guide dentist recommendations for fluoride rinses in children. We conducted this in vitro study on 36 sound primary incisors. We divided the teeth into 3 study groups: Group A teeth were treated with deionized water, Group B teeth were treated with 0.02% NaF mouthrinse and Group C teeth were treated with 0.05% NaF mouthrinse. We created demineralized lesions in all study teeth by immersing them all in a demineralizing solution at a pH of 4.4 at temperature of 37 degrees C for 96 hours. Each group of teeth were then immersed in their respective study solution for 1 minute 3 times a day for 1 week and to imitate the oral environment all the study teeth were placed in demineralizing solution for 3 hours twice daily and the rest of the time the teeth were placed in remineralizing solution for 1 week. Each tooth was then examined with polarized light microscopy and the lesion depth was measured for each tooth and the 3 groups were compared using Image-Pro Plus software. Data were analyzed using Paired-t, one-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparison tests at a 95% level of confidence. After a 7-day cycle, mean lesion depths in all groups had increased significantly (p&lt;0.05). Group A (control group) was significantly different from the other groups (B, C) (p&lt;0.05). No significant differences were found between Groups B and C (p=0.286). We conclude the 0.02% NaF and 0.05% NaF moutrinses in this study were equal in their deceleration of enamel primary caries progression.</td>

      <td>Analysis of the Effect of Protective Properties of Concretes with Similar Composition on the Corrosion Rate of Reinforcing Steel Induced by Chloride Ions</td>
      <td>This study presents a comparison of the protective properties of three concretes of similar composition on the effect of chloride ions. To determine these properties, the values of the diffusion and migration coefficients of chloride ions in concrete were determined using both standard methods and the thermodynamic ion migration model. We tested a comprehensive method for checking the protective properties of concrete against chlorides. This method can not only be used in various concretes, even those with only small differences in composition, but also in concretes with various types of admixtures and additives, such as PVA fibers. The research was carried out to address the needs of a manufacturer of prefabricated concrete foundations. The aim was to find a cheap and effective method of sealing the concrete produced by the manufacturer in order to carry out projects in coastal areas. Earlier diffusion studies showed good performance when replacing ordinary CEM I cement with metallurgical cement. The corrosion rates of the reinforcing steel in these concretes were also compared using the following electrochemical methods: linear polarization and impedance spectroscopy. The porosities of these concretes, determined using X-ray computed tomography for pore-related characterization, were also compared. Changes in the phase composition of corrosion products occurring in the steel-concrete contact zone were compared using scanning electron microscopy with a micro-area chemical analysis capability, in addition to X-ray microdiffraction, to study the microstructure changes. Concrete with CEM III cement was the most resistant to chloride ingress and therefore provided the longest period of protection against chloride-initiated corrosion. The least resistant was concrete with CEM I, for which, after two 7-day cycles of chloride migration in the electric field, steel corrosion started. The additional use of a sealing admixture can cause a local increase in the volume of pores in the concrete, and at the same time, a local weakening of the concrete structure. Concrete with CEM I was characterized as having the highest porosity at 140.537 pores, whereas concrete with CEM III (characterized by lower porosity) had 123.015 pores. Concrete with sealing admixture, with the same open porosity, had the highest number of pores, at 174.880. According to the findings of this study, and using a computed tomography method, concrete with CEM III showed the most uniform distribution of pores of different volumes, and had the lowest total number of pores.</td>

The aim of this study was to assess the overall survival of dogs diagnosed with oral melanoma and treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy.Materials, Methods &amp; Results: A retrospective analysis was carried out in 20 dogs with oral melanocytic or amelanocytic melanomas. Cases were staged according to a modified World Health Organization clinical staging system for canine oral malignant melanoma. Tumor size (T1: &lt; 2 cm; T2: 2 - 4 cm; T3: &gt; 4 cm), regional metastasis (N0: no metastasis; N1: metastasis) and presence of distant metastasis (M0: no metastasis; M1: metastasis) are evaluated. Then, cases were divided into 4 stages: I (T1 N0 M0), II (T2 N0 M0), III (T3 N0-1 M0, Tx N1 M0) and IV (Tx Nx M1). Diagnoses were confirmed with histopathological exam and immunohistochemistry (IHC) when necessary. In poorly differentiated neoplasms, IHC was performed at the request of the submitting veterinarian using specific markers PNL-2 and Melan-A. Animals were divided into 2 groups: dogs submitted to surgery alone were included in group 1 (G1); dogs submitted to surgery associated with adjuvant chemotherapy with four 21-day cycles of carboplatin (300 mg/m(2)) and immunotherapy with six 7-day cycles of interferon-a (3 x 106 IU/m(2)) were included in group 2 (G2). Twenty dogs diagnosed with oral melanoma were evaluated: 3 were included in G1 and 17 in G2. Considering clinical staging of the dogs: 7 stage II, 12 stage III and only 1 stage IV. There was no stage I patients. In poorly differentiated neoplasias, IHC was performed at the request of the submitting veterinarian using specific markers PNL-2 and Melan-A. Patient follow-up was obtained through the evaluation of patient records and telephone interviews with owners. The overall survival time (OS) was defined by the period (in days) between the date of surgical excision and the death caused by the disease. Median overall survival time was 86 days for animals in G1 and 894 days for animals in G2 (P = 0.01).Discussion: Carboplatin was considered an appropriate cytostatic drug to treat microscopic disease in oral melanoma. INF-alpha was chosen for immunotherapy in this study because it promotes immune system stimulation associated with an indirect antiproliferative effect on neoplastic cells. The association of INF-alpha and carboplatin resulted in a significant increase in overall survival, when compared to the literature, suggesting that association of chemotherapy and immunomodulation is an important strategy in the treatment of canine oral melanoma. Controlled prospective randomized trials are necessary to confirm the benefits of chemotherapy and immunotherapy association to treat canine oral melanoma. Adjuvant therapy with chemotherapy and immunotherapy was considered effective to increase overall survival and maintained quality of life of dogs diagnosed with oral melanoma.</td>
